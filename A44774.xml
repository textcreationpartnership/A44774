            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is active; ſo that though both flow from the <hi>Fountains</hi> of one and the ſame <hi>Nature;</hi> yet the one reſting in a <hi>Material Repletion,</hi> muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged more <hi>limited</hi> than the other, which admits of no <hi>bounds</hi> of <hi>Satiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though <hi>Knowledge</hi> be <hi>Mans Natural Deſire,</hi> and the <hi>Similary Nouriſhment</hi> of his better part, the <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Soul;</hi> yet it is not alike ſought after by all; nor in the ſame <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Kind.</hi>

            <p>Some, whoſe <hi>Conſtitution</hi> has diſpoſed them to a <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>laſie Senſuality,</hi> and others, whom <hi>continual Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> have baffled into a

They had Prieſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers, the chief of which were called <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides,</hi> who were the ſacrificers, diſcuſſers and interpreters of Religious matters; they deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo as temporal Judges almoſt all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in the civil State, and ſuch as refuſed to ſtand to their judgment, they put under their Interdiction, which was accounted the moſt grievous puniſhment. Theſe <hi>Druides</hi> were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged from the Wars, and all other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, taxes and payments. Over all the reſt of them there was one Primate. The main thing they laboured to perſwade men was, That the Soul is immortal. They taught only by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>The Merchandizing of the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> conſiſted chiefly in Ivory Boxes, Sheers, Onch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Bits and Bridles, Wreaths and Chains, with other conceits made of Glaſs and Amber. And as their Merchandize was mean, ſo was their Shipping alſo, the Keels and Ribs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were of light wood covered over with Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Their Coyn was either of Braſs, or elſe Iron-Rings ſized at a certain weight, which they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for their Money; but as times grew more civil, and Traffick more frequent, they ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Gold and Silver.</p>
               <p>Their Armour were Shields and ſhort Spears, in the lower of which Spears was faſtned a round Bell of Braſs, which at the beginning of a fight they ſhoke with a great courage,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109115:22"/>
conceiting that ſuch a ratling noiſe did diſmay the enemy. In the beginning of a Battel they fought in Chariots, but when they had wound themſelves in amongſt their enemies, they fought on foot, upon occaſion retiring to their Chariots, which in the mean ſpace that they fought on foot, were drawn all together. They were ſo expert in managing their Chariot-Horſes, that running them forceably down a ſteep Hill, they could ſtop and turn them in the mid-way.</p>

                     <hi>HENRY PLANTAGINET</hi> the Son of <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, and Earl <hi>Geofry</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And <hi>Henry</hi> to ſettle the Realm in quiet, demoliſhed certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and fortified others. Some Earls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly created, he reduced into a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, purged the Realm of Foreign Soldiers; chiefly of the <hi>Flemings.</hi> Choſe himſelf a Councel out of the moſt eminent perſons ſpiritual and temporal, and reſtrained the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies of ſome great perſonages, which made ſome of them diſcontented, eſpecially that arrogant Lord <hi>Hugh de Mortimer,</hi> who raiſed a Rebellion. Againſt whom the King went in perſon, where in the Siege of <hi>Bridge-North</hi>

he had been ſhot with an arrow, had not <hi>Hubert de St. Clare</hi> interpoſed and took the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into his own boſome. The King having quieted the Rebels, he haſted into <hi>France,</hi> and there did homage to King <hi>Lewis</hi> for his <hi>French</hi> Provinces, ſetled an accord between himſelf and Brother <hi>Geofry,</hi> and at his return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> entred into amity with <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> reſtoring to him the Earldom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon.</hi> Then he advanced againſt the <hi>Welſh,</hi> with whom fighting, his perſon was in great danger, his Standard-royal cowardly abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the which <hi>Henry de Eſſex</hi> Standard-bearer, was afterward accuſed by <hi>Robert de Montford,</hi> who in ſingle combat within liſts vanquiſhed him at <hi>Reading,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> was ſhorn a Monk: But the King at length overcame the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and returned with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into <hi>England;</hi> after which, himſelf and his Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> were crowned at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where they both at the Offertory laid their Crowns upon the high Altar, vowing never to wear them after. This now was the third time in which at three ſeveral places <hi>Weſtminſter, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he had been crowned.</p>
                  <p>Then the King croſt the ſeas into his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he made ſeizure of ſome Cities into his hands after his Brother <hi>Geofry</hi>'s death, and ſetled ſome affairs, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.

to be Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tho. Becket <hi>A.B.</hi> Cant.</note> Which Archbiſhoprick <hi>Becket</hi> at the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> ſecretly delivered up to the Pope, and received it again from his hands. But the cauſe of the diſſention betwixt the King and this Biſhop, was the remiſneſs and neglect of <hi>Becket</hi>'s curbing the diſorders of the Church-men, which then were grown to a dangerous height; complaint having been made to the King of above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Murders committed by the Clergy in his reign. Which enormities, beſides many others of other kinds, not being puniſhed by Church-cenſure, the King exceedingly diſpleaſed, brought them under the Civil Power, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Juſtice ſhould be adminiſtred to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like without partiality, as well Clergy as Laity; appointing Miniſters of Juſtice through all parts of the Land to that purpoſe: againſt which <hi>Becket</hi> oppoſed himſelf, peremptorily defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pretended Rights of the Clergy, and his See of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> yea ſo far, as that he challenged from the Crown the cuſtody of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> Caſtle, and other Forts, which the King for ſecuring his ſtate had reſumed into his own hands. Hereupon the King aſſembling his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> it was there agreed, That none ſhould appeal to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in any caſe without the King's leave. That no Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop or Biſhop upon the Popes ſummons ſhould go out of the Realm without the Kings licenſe. That no Biſhop ſhould excommunicate any holding of the King in chief, or put any of his Officers under interdict, without the Kings licenſe. That Clerks criminous ſhould
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109115:85"/>
be tryed before Secular Judges. Unto which Articles the King peremptorily urged <hi>Becket</hi> to yeild, without any reſervation of ſaving in all things his order and right of the Church. But <hi>Becket</hi> utterly refuſed, ſending complaints thereupon to the Pope, who very deſirous to keep the Kings favour, required the Biſhop to yeild unto the King without any ſalvo's or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. So <hi>Becket,</hi> though with much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, at length did ſwear <hi>in verbo Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali &amp; de plano,</hi> that he would obſerve the Laws which the King intituled <hi>Avitae,</hi> of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the like to which did all the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Nobility. But notwithſtanding <hi>Becket</hi> refuſed to ſet his ſeal to the Inſtrument wherein theſe Cuſtoms were comprehended, alledging that he did promiſe it only to do the King ſome honour in word only, but not with intent to confirm the ſaid Articles. Whereupon the King ſent to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, thinking by his means to have ſubjected the Prelate. But he paſſing it by, the King undertook the caſe himſelf, and by his Peers and Biſhops, had all <hi>Beckets</hi> movable Goods condemned to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; they alſo adjudging him guilty of perjury. The Biſhops did by the mouth of the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> diſclaim thenceforward all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him as their Arch-biſhop. And the next day, whilſt they were conſulting further concerning him, the Biſhop cauſed to be ſung before him at the Altar, <hi>The Princes ſit and ſpeak againſt me, and the ungodly perſecute me,</hi> &amp;c. and forthwith taking his ſilver Croſier in his hands, he entred therewith into the Kings
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109115:86"/>
preſence. But the King enraged at his boldneſs, commanded his Peers to ſit in judgment on him, and they adjudged him as a Traytor and perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſon to be apprehended and caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To prevent which, <hi>Becket</hi> fled into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the Pope now openly ſiding with him, and alſo <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King. But <hi>Henry</hi> to let the <hi>Servant of ſervants</hi> know that he was ſupreme in his own Kingdom, and that he liked not his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king part with a ſubject againſt his Sovereign Lord, commanded the Sheriffs to attack ſuch as did appeal to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy as were with <hi>Becket,</hi> and to put them under Sureties; Alſo to ſeize their Revenues, Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. The King likewiſe ſeized all the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Goods and Profits, baniſhed his Kindred, prohibited his being publickly prayed for as Archbiſhop: Commanded his Juſtices to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and ſecure all ſuch as ſhould bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Interdict into <hi>England</hi> till the Kings pleaſure was further known. On the other hand, <hi>Becket</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by ſpecial authority from the Pope, excommunicated the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far with others, that there was ſcarce found in the Kings Chappel ſuch as might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the wonted Service. Hereupon the King ſends again to the Pope, to ſend him Legates which might abſolve his excommunicate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſettle a Peace. But the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates whom he ſent, did not effect a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of <hi>Becket</hi>'s perverſneſs. Some conjecture, that in contempt of <hi>Becket</hi> (whoſe Office it was as Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109115:86"/>
Crown the King) King <hi>Henry</hi> cauſed his eldeſt ſon <hi>Henry</hi> to be crowned King of <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi> At whoſe Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-feaſt the Father-King himſelf carrying up the firſt diſh of Meat, the Archbiſhop pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to the young King, <hi>Rejoyce, my fair Son, for there is no Prince in the world that hath ſuch a Servitor attending at his Table, as you have.</hi> To whom the proud young King thus anſwered, <hi>Why wonder you at that? My Father knows that he doth nothing unbeſeeming him, foraſmuch as he is royal born but on-one ſide, but Our ſelf are royal born both by Father and Mother.</hi> Not long after this, by mediation of ſome friends, a reconciliation between the King and <hi>Becket</hi> was effected; and <hi>Becket</hi> was permitted to have the full uſe of his Metropolitan See, and all the profits thereof, with the Arrearages. Which he had not long re-poſſeſſed, ere he publiſhed the Popes Letters, by which <hi>Roger</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> were ſuſpended from their Epiſcopal Function for crowning the yong King in prejudice of the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And the Biſhops of <hi>London, Sarum,</hi> and <hi>Exceſter,</hi> cut off from the Church by Cenſure; for aſſiſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; whom <hi>Becket</hi> would not abſolve at the young Kings requeſt, but under conditions: Which the old King then in <hi>Normandy</hi> hearing of, let fall ſome words, intimating his high diſpleaſure againſt the Archbiſhop, and deſire to be rid of him. Whereupon <hi>Hugh Morvill, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Tracie, Hugh Brito,</hi> and <hi>Richard Fits-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſe,</hi> Knights and Courtiers, haſted into <hi>England,</hi> and murder'd the Archbiſhop in the Cathedral

                     </note> as he ſtood in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-ſervice-time before the Altar. Which done, the Parricides fled, and <hi>Thomas</hi> was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a moſt Glorious Saint and Martyr, and ſtrange Miracles (beyond my Creed) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been done by this dead <hi>Roman</hi>-Saint, and his blood. Amongſt other Epitaphs made on his death, this was one:
<q>
                        <l>Quis moritur? praeſul. Cur? pro grege. Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter? enſe.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the news of this vile act coming to the ears of the old King, he was exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and to take off the imputation of Guilt from himſelf, he proteſted that he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to the judgment of ſuch Cardinal Legates as the Pope ſhould ſend to enquire of the fact. And to calm his own perturbations, and avert mens thoughts from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Tragedy, he undertook the conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he effected (being helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward therein by the Civil diſſentions then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> petty Kings). Where having cauſed a reformation of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Church, and ſetled affairs therein to his conveniency, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> and from thence poſted into <hi>Normandy;</hi> where attended for his arrival two Cardinal-Legats (ſent at his own requeſt for his purgation concerning <hi>Thomas a Becket</hi>'s death) by whom he was abſolved: Having firſt given oath, that he was no way conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fact, and declared his ſorrow for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109115:87"/>
in his anger, given occaſion by raſh words for others to do the deed, and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to perform injoyned penances. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his abſolution were, That at his own charge he ſhould maintain 200 Soldiers a whole year, for the defence of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and that he ſhould revoke the Laws which he had made againſt the priviledges of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Beckets</hi> friends. And now this Cloud thus blown over, another ſucceeds in its place, For his unnatural Son young King <hi>Henry,</hi> (by the inſtigation of his Mother Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi>) conſpired againſt him, having for his confederates the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> his two Brothers <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Geofry,</hi> with many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles.

The number of laſhes which he received on his bare fleſh amounted to Fourſcore. About this time <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> that had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entred <hi>England,</hi> was taken Priſoner, and young King <hi>Henry</hi> was with ſtorms driven back into <hi>France,</hi> and his Fleet ſcattered, ſhortly after which, Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Father and him. But yet again he ſought his Fathers ruine, though before he could effect it, he was prevented by the King of Terrors, Death, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1183.

Richard</hi> and <hi>Geoffery</hi> his Sons rebelled again againſt him: The younger of which in a Turnament at <hi>Paris</hi> was trod to death under the Horſe feet, but the elder lived to the further grief of his Father. For joyning himſelf with <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> forced his Father out of the City of <hi>Mentz</hi> (the City where he was born, and loved above all others) which made King

But coming to <hi>Chinon,</hi> he there fell deſperately ſick, and feeling death approach, cauſed himſelf to be born into the Church before the Altar, where after humble confeſſion and ſorrow for his ſins, he yielded up his Soul, <hi>A.

Whereupon an Arbalaſter ſtanding upon the Wall, and ſeeing his time, charged his Steel-bow with a Square-Arrow, making firſt his Prayer to God, that he would direct that ſhot, and deliver the innocency of the beſieged from oppreſſion; then diſcharging it, as the King was taking a view of the Caſtle, mortally wounded him in the left ſhoulder, the anguiſh and peril whereof, was extreamly increaſed by the unskilfulneſs of the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.

The Lay-people were tumbled like Dogs into every Ditch. Howbeit the King to be even with the Pope, proſcribed the diſloyal Clergy, their revenues he confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, their Biſhopricks, Abbies and Priories he put into Laymens hands, and every-where they ſuffered wrong, without ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of juſtice.

better to ſecure himſelf, and State, the King was very deſirous to come to an atonement, and aſſured under his Seal, that Archbiſhop <hi>Langton,</hi> with the Biſhops and Monks, and others, ſhould be reſtored both to his favour and their poſſeſſions; that Holy Church ſhould have all its Franchiſes, as in <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors time: But becauſe he would not make full ſatisfaction to the Clergy, for all confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other emoluments received of them, the Popes Nuncio's refuſed a peace with him. And the Pope was ſo mad, that he abſolved all Kings and people, poor and rich, having dependence on him from all fealty and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; whereupon, Male-contents ſet themſelves to work miſchief. The <hi>Welſh</hi> fall off from the King, wherefore at <hi>Nottingham</hi> he hangs up their hoſtages, 28 in number.

his Letters general, to all Potentates, Soldiers, Men of War of all Nations, to ſign themſelves with the ſign of the Croſs, and to follow <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> in this deſign, aſſuring all that their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance herein, whether in perſon or purſe, ſhould be no leſs meritorious, than if they viſited our Saviours Sepulcher. The King of <hi>France</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the offer, and makes great preparation for the invading of <hi>England,</hi> and King <hi>John</hi> raiſes a Land-Army, and prepares a Royal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to withſtand him. But ere the <hi>French</hi> make their attempts, <hi>Pandulph</hi> the Popes Meſſenger arrives in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo wrought upon the King, what by repreſenting the danger he was in, and what by flattering promiſes, that King <hi>John</hi> (not inſenſible of his deſperate eſtate) ſware in all things to ſubmit to the judgment of the Church. And ſhortly after at the Knight-Templers Houſe in <hi>Dover,</hi> he ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his Crown into the hands of <hi>Pandulph,</hi> for the uſe of the Pope, laying at his feet his Scepter, Robe, Sword and Ring, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to a Charter, whereby he reſigned his Kingdom to the Pope: Profeſſing he did it neither through fear or force, but of his own free will, as having no other way to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God and the Church for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And that from that time forward he would hold his Crown of the Pope, paying a penſion annual of a Thouſand Marks, for the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland. Pandulph</hi> now having got what he came for, haſtens into <hi>France,</hi> there to diſſwade <hi>Philip</hi> from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt King <hi>John,</hi> as being become an
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109115:97"/>
obedient and reconciled Son to the Church. But <hi>Philip,</hi> who was of his holy Fathers mind, not caring for K. <hi>John</hi>'s repentance, but his Crown, in great choler profeſſed, <hi>That ſince the Pope himſelf had ſo far thruſt him on, his Legats ſuggeſtions, no nor his threats of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, ſhould not withdraw him from his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> In which reſolution, calling his Peers into a conſultation, they all approved his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſave <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it was an unreaſonable thing to think of invading another mans right; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing this his judgment with ſo good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that thereby many of the Peers were induced to change their opinion. Which ſo incenſed K. <hi>Philip,</hi> that he drew his Forces againſt <hi>Flanders,</hi> commanding his mighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Fleet to ſet forward thitherward. Of the which K. <hi>John</hi> having ſpeedy intelligence, ſet forth his Navy, and happily ſurprized the <hi>French</hi> Fleet at the Port of <hi>Damme</hi> (whilſt moſt of the Soldiers were on Land, ſpoiling the Earls Country) taking 300 Veſſels laden with Proviſions, Arms, and other coſtly fraught, and burning and ſinking above an 100. And now the King thinking to take the advantage of this Victory, made ready a great Army for the recovery of his hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces loſt to the <hi>French;</hi> but when all elſe was ready, then the Barons denied him their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, till he was aſſoyled of his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and that their priſtine liberties granted them by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt were reſtored. <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> animating them herein; and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109115:98"/>
promiſing his faithful aſſiſtance to them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King makes his appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Pope with rich preſents; in anſwer to which, the Pope ſent his Legate the Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> who wrought with the King to corroborate the conveyance of his Kingdoms to the Pope; unto which the King yielded. But the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> oppoſed himſelf againſt it, with whom the Peers of the Land joyned, avowing it to be an execrable thing to the whole World. And in a full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was Enacted, <hi>That ſince the King could not without conſent of Parliament bring his Realm and people to ſuch thraldom; therefore if the Pope ſhould in the future attempt any ſuch thing again, with life and livelihood he ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</hi> The Pope hearing of this, not only conceived exceeding hatred againſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop; but ſent alſo his authentick Letters for repealing the Interdict, upon reſtitution of 1300 Marks more to the Prelates, and that but by equal portions of five years payment. And now the King paſſed into <hi>Poictou</hi> which he reduced, thence into <hi>Britain,</hi> where his <hi>Poicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,</hi> according to their old cuſtome, proved falſe to him to his great detriment. The while his Barons they play <hi>Rex</hi> at home, renewing their confederation, and binding themſelves with an Oath at the High Altar at St. <hi>Edmondſ; bury,</hi> That they would purſue the King with Arms, till he ſhould conſent to the Charter of Liberties, granted by <hi>Henry</hi> 1ſt. So that the King was inforced to return into <hi>England,</hi> where, when come, they challenged this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109115:98"/>
as a part of his Oath made at his Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhortly after they met together at <hi>Stamford</hi> with a very numerous Army. Their General was <hi>Robert Fitz-Walter,</hi> whom they ſtiled, The Marſhal of Gods Army and Holy Church. <hi>London</hi> invited them to enter the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by night, where, when entred, by their threatful Letters, they not only drew moſt of the Nobles from the King, but had alſo almoſt lockt him out of his Royal Seat, inſomuch, that he was neceſſitated by gentle meſſages, to procure of his factious Barons a place and day of meeting, which was <hi>Running-Mead,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Stains,</hi> (ſince called <hi>Councel-Mead</hi>) whither they came with Armed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, out of all the Kingdom, numberleſs. Where the King perceiving their ſo great ſtrength, and his own ſmall party, he granted them the utmoſt of their deſires, not only for liberties ſpecified in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta Foreſtae,</hi> but alſo for a kind of rule in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by 25 ſelected Peers, to whoſe command all the other Barons, were alſo bound by Oath to be obedient. But the King could not long reliſh this, therefore privately ſends to his truſtieſt friends to fortify and victual their Caſtles, and himſelf ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> From whence he diſpatched Meſſengers both to the Pope and his foreign friends, to crave the cenſure of the one, and ſuccours of the other, againſt ſuch outragious Rebels. In both which his Agents were ſo ſedulous, and friends compaſſionate, that at <hi>Rome</hi> by definitive ſentence, the Barons
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109115:99"/>
Charters were made voyd, the King and Barons accurſed, if either of them obſerved the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made at <hi>Councel-Mead.</hi> And from <hi>Flanders, Goſcoin, Brabrant,</hi> and other parts, ſuch competent aids came in, as incouraged the King, after Three Months ſecrecy, to ſhew himſelf in the face of his Enemies. His Hoſt he divided into two parts; with the one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by himſelf Northward, he every-where ſubdued his Rebels, as likewiſe did the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Southward. <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> the Pope ſuſpended for abetting the Barons; and his Brother <hi>Simon Langton</hi> Archbiſhop elect of <hi>York,</hi> had his election made voyd, the Pope conſtituting in his place <hi>Walter Gray,</hi> whoſe Pall coſt him no leſs than 1000 pounds. [The Archiepiſcopal Pall is a Pontifical Veſtment made of Lambs wooll, as it comes from the Sheeps back, without any other artificial co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſpun by a peculiar order of Nuns, caſt into St. <hi>Peters</hi> Tomb, and adorned with little black Croſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having two Labells hanging down before and behind; which the Archbiſhops, when going to the Altar, put about their Necks, above their other pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ornaments.] The diſloyal Barons were all excommunicated by name, and all their Lands, together with the City of <hi>London</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. But the lofty Barons held thoſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in ſo high contempt, that they decreed neither themſelves nor Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſhould obſerve them, nor the Prelates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them. And to revive their dying Cauſe, they reſolve on a project for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109115:99"/>
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſending their Letters of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, confirmed with all the Barons Seals, to implore K. <hi>Philips</hi> favour for ſending his Son, and his Son for the acceptance of the Engliſh Crown. To prevent a correſpondency herein, the Pope ſends his Apoſtolical Commands to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that he ſhould ſtay his Son from entring upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony, with a Curſe alſo on all ſuch, as ſhould aſſiſt the excommunicate Barons. To which <hi>Philip</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That England was no patrimony of St. Peters, no King,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having power of himſelf to alienate his Kingdom, K.</hi> John <hi>eſpecially, who being never lawful King, had no power to diſpoſe thereof; and that it was an error and pernicious example in the Pope, and an itching luſt after a new kind of Domination.</hi> His Peers ſwore, <hi>That they would ſpend their blood, rather than ſuffer that a King ſhould of himſelf, or with a few flatterers, paſs over his Crown, and enthrall his Nobles, eſpecially to the Pope, who ſhould follow St.</hi> Peters <hi>ſteps, to win ſouls, and not to meddle with Wars, and murders of mens bodies.</hi> And Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> declared, That <hi>he would chuſe rather to be excommunicated by the Pope, than to falſifie his promiſe to the Engliſh Barons.</hi> So without more ado, he ſpeedily ſet forth for <hi>England,</hi> with his Fleet of 600 Ships, and 80 Boats, which coming to ſhore in <hi>Kent,</hi> the Barons joyned forces with him. King <hi>John</hi> whoſe Army conſiſted moſt of ſtipendiary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, thought it beſt for a time to forbear Battel with <hi>Lewis,</hi> and not to commit his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109115:100"/>
whole fortunes to the hazard of their ſudden defection; therefore drew towards <hi>Wincheſter, Lewis</hi> marching forward towards <hi>London,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the ſtrong-holds in his way (excepting <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, kept by the valiant and faithful <hi>Hubert de Burgo.) London</hi> received <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Citizens ſwearing truth to him, ſo did the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons at <hi>Weſtminſter, Lewis</hi> ſwearing to them, <hi>That he would reſtore all men their right, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the Crown what ever had been loſt by K.</hi> John. All or moſt places where the <hi>French</hi> Prince came ſubmitted to him. At <hi>Odiam</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle indeed (wherein were but 13 Engliſh men) <hi>Lewis</hi> and his whole Army, was not only braved 15 days; but alſo ſallying forth upon them, every one took an enemy, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Caſtle at laſt upon honourable terms. K. <hi>John</hi> in other parts of the Realm, with a very conſiderable Hoſt ruined the Barons Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and poſſeſſions. But ſetting forth from <hi>Lyn</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> (where for their faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he beſtowed large Franchiſes, and his own Sword, and a gilt Bowl) with a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to give <hi>Lewis</hi> Battel; as he was paſſing the Waſhes, with his Army and Carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> all his Carriages, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Proviſion were irrecoverably loſt, himſelf and Army hardly eſcaping. And now by this time, the Barons were ſtruck with ſome remorſe to ſee their Native Country by their procurement to be ſo miſerably waſted, and afflicted; and which grieved them the moſt was, that their faithful ſervices to <hi>Lewis,</hi> were but ſlightly regarded by him at preſent, and were
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109115:100"/>
like to be ill repayed in the future; for Viſcount <hi>De Melun</hi> a Noble <hi>Frenchman,</hi> had on his death bed privately diſcovered to them, how that <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſworn, That if ever <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Crown was ſetled on his head, he would condemn unto perpetual exile all the diſloyal Barons, as Traytors to their Sovereign, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate all their kindred. Forty of the Barons therefore preſently addreſſed their Letters of ſubmiſſive ſuit to the King, but he was dead before the Meſſengers came. Some ſay he dyed of a <hi>Flix,</hi> ſome of a <hi>Surfeit;</hi> but the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he dyed of Poyſon; for K. <hi>John</hi> coming, ſay they, from the Waſhes to <hi>Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi> Abby, and there taking notice as he ſat at meat, of their too prodigal proviſion, he ſwore, That if he lived but half a year longer, he would make one half-peny Loaf as dear as twelve. To prevent which, a Monk pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with an invenomed Cup, taſting firſt thereof himſelf, ſo becoming the wicked inſtrument of his own and Sovereigns death, <hi>Octob.</hi> 19, 1216. He was buried at <hi>Worceſter.</hi> His Iſſue were <hi>Henry, Richard, Joan, Eleanor</hi> and <hi>Iſabel.</hi> Baſe iſſue, <hi>Jeffry Fitz-Roy, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and <hi>Jane.</hi> He appointed thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent forms of Civil government in the Cities and incorporate Towns of <hi>England,</hi> endowing them alſo with their greateſt Franchiſes. He ſetled the rates and meaſures for Wine, Bread, Cloth, and ſuch like neceſſaries of Commerce. He planted Engliſh Laws and Officers in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Now lived one <hi>Simon Thurvey,</hi> who for his pride in Learning, eſpecially for his blaſphemies

This Noble Earl ſet out againſt <hi>Lewis,</hi> and at <hi>Lincolne</hi> utterly defeated his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which diſcomfiture was called <hi>Lewis Fair,</hi> from the great ſpoil that the Earls Soldiers took from the <hi>Lewyſians</hi> and City of <hi>Lincolne.</hi> Here the chiefeſt of the malignant Barons were taken, with about 400 Knights, beſides Eſquires, and of other ſorts innumerable.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109115:103"/>
accuſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and others for the committing of many great crimes, and he doubting that he ſhould not have a fair Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, retired himſelf into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whither he was proſecuted by Armed men, and in a Chappel at <hi>Burntwood</hi> was apprehended; out of which the rude Soldiers hailed him, and ſent for a Smith to make Shackles for him; which when the Smith underſtood that they were for him, fetching a deep ſigh, he ſaid, <hi>Do with me what you pleaſe, and God have mercy on my ſoul; but as ſure as the Lord lives, I will never make Iron-Shackles for him, but will rather dye the worſt death that is. For is not this the moſt Loyal, and Courageous</hi> Hubert, <hi>who ſo often hath preſerved</hi> England <hi>from being deſtroyed by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and reſtored</hi> England <hi>to</hi> England? <hi>Let God be judge between him and you, for uſing him ſo unjuſtly and inhumanely, requiting his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſerts, with the worſt recompence that can be.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this, Sir <hi>Godfrey de Crancomb</hi> who commanded the party, bound the Earl, and conveyed him to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he had not long been, ere the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> procured his liberty, though ſhortly after he was again impriſoned. In his place the King elected for his Councellor and Confident, <hi>Peter de Rupibus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> who diſplaced the Engliſh Officers, and in their Rooms placed <hi>Poictovins</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> ſtuffing the Kings Caſtles with them, intruſting as it were the treaſures, ſtrength and Realm it ſelf in their hands, to the great diſcontent of the Engliſh Peers. Who now confederated

againſt the ſtrangers, and refuſed upon the Kings ſummons to appear in Parliament; ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this impudent Meſſage to their Soveraign, That if out of hand he removed not the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſtrangers out of his Court, they all of them, by the common conſent of the Kingdom, would drive him and his wicked Counſellors out of it, and would conſult about creating of a new King. Whereupon the King (animated by <hi>Wincheſter</hi>) commanded the Earl-Marſhal, with all others whom he ſuſpected, to appear at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where the King was with an Army: Which they refuſing to do, the King burnt their Mannors, and gave away their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances to the <hi>Poictovins.</hi> The Earl-Marſhal he contracts ſtrict amity with <hi>Leweylyn</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and made great ſpoil on the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kings reputed Seducers. <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> he ſackt and burnt. <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord <hi>Baſſet,</hi> the Earls great Confederate, ſet fire on <hi>Alkmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> not far from <hi>Huntingdon.</hi> But the Earl-Marſhal having croſſed the ſeas into <hi>Ireland,</hi> there to recover his Lands taken from him by the fraud of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was there wounded to death; for whoſe loſs the King, to the wonder of all that ſaw it, broke forth into tears, affirming, That he had left no Peer about him in the Kingdom. And now the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> hated of the people, was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King not to meddle any farther in State-matters. And againſt <hi>Peter Rivallis</hi> Lord Treaſurer, the King was ſo in raged, that he ſware he would pluck out his eyes, were it not for reverence of holy Orders. And by the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109115:104"/>
workings of the Biſhops, an accord was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the King and his Peers, and the <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctovins</hi> were commanded to depart the Realm. Howbeit the Land was not yet eaſed of its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors and Oppreſſions; for the Pope ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into <hi>England</hi> three hundred <hi>Romans,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have the firſt Benefice that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vacant, to be beſtowed on them; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo great ſums of money of the Clergy for maintenance of the Pope's Wars againſt the Emperor: Which though the Clergy at firſt oppoſed, yet were forced to yeild unto it at the laſt. The Pope himſelf had a mind to have come hither in his own perſon, but the King's Councel liked not thereof; alledging, that the <hi>Romans</hi> Rapines and Simonies had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſtained <hi>England</hi>'s purity, though the Pope himſelf came not perſonally to ſpoil and prey upon the Wealth of the Church.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1240, <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> the King's Brother, with the Earls of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, Cheſter, Lincoln, Salisbury,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honourable perſons, departed for the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and in <hi>A. D.</hi> 1242, the King paſſed the Seas to recover <hi>Poictou,</hi> but effected not any thing remarkable, though he expended great ſtore of Treaſure. Upon his return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he was therefore compelled to be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to his ſubjects for recruiting of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Treaſure, as well by the levy of Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as of Loan and otherwiſe. The Jews in eſpecial manner were made ſenſible of his wants. Too much of their money, thus rais'd, 'tis ſaid he expended in Entertainments and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109115:104"/>
Shows; though afterward the King reflecting on his former profuſeneſs in gifts and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſhortned the allowances of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and entertainments, without any regard to Majeſty. And to ſpare his own charge the more, he invited himſelf now to this mans houſe, now to that; but no-where contenting himſelf with his welcome, unleſs himſelf and his Queen, Son <hi>Edward,</hi> yea, and chief Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, were preſented with coſtly Gifts. 'Tis ſaid that he was ſometime reduced to that penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he was forced to live upon the Alms of the Church. This King deſigned, at leaſt pretended, to go for the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> when the Parliament granted him large Aids upon this condition, That at this time once for all, he ſhould ſubmit himſelf to govern by Law, to confirm the Charters of Liberties, or <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> Againſt the breakers whereof, a moſt ſolemn curſe was pronounced.

                  <p>And now the King relapſed into his profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and favouring of the <hi>Poictovins,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forreigners: The Nobles hereupon came exquiſitely armed to the Parliament holden at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with a reſolution to inforce the King and his Aliens to their propoſals; Which were, That the King ſhould unfeignedly keep the Charter of Liberties: That ſuch an one ſhould be in place of Juſtitiar, who would judg all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially. That the Forreigners ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Realm: And that twenty-four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould there be choſen to have the ſole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of King and State; and yearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of all great Officers.

they joined with the Barons as the Aſſertors of their Liberties:<note place="margin">Boniface, <hi>A.

And the better to ſtrengthen their Cauſe, <hi>Simon Montford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> Head of the Factioniſts, with others, paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> there to tranſact with the King thereof, as to an indiſſoluble League.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109115:106"/>
ſort into ſo leud a rage, that ſhe being to ſhoot the Bridg from the <hi>Tower</hi> towards <hi>Windſor,</hi> where Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was ingariſon'd, they with dirt and ſtones, and villanous words, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her back to the Tower. Howbeit at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in a Parliament there held, matters were pieced up, though ſhortly after all was rent again, both ſides making freſh preparations for War. King <hi>Henry</hi> drew towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the rendezvous of his friends and forces was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; from which Univerſity he diſmiſſed all the Students, being above fifteen thouſand, of thoſe only whoſe names were entred into the Matriculation-book. Whereupon many of them went to the Barons to <hi>Northamptor,</hi> whither <hi>Henry</hi> came, and breaking in at the Town-Walls, encountred his Enemies, amongſt whom theſe Students of <hi>Oxford</hi> had a Banner by themſelves, advanced right againſt the King, and did more annoy him in the fight, than the reſt of the Barons Forces: Which the King (who at length prevailed) vowed ſharply to revenge; but was diſſwaded by his Councellors, who told him that thoſe Students were the ſons and kindred of the great men of the Land, whom if he puniſhed, even the Nobles that now ſtood for him, would take arms againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The King, encouraged by this ſucceſs, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his Royal Standard toward <hi>Nottingham,</hi> burning and waſting the Barons Lands where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came.

At length the two Armies met, and ingaged in fight, wherein Prince <hi>Edward</hi> bravely behaved himſelf, putting the <hi>Londoners</hi> to flight, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for four miles; but in the mean while, his Father having his horſe ſlain under him, yielded himſelf priſoner: the King of <hi>Romans,</hi> and other great Peers were taken, and the whole hope of the day loſt on the Kings ſide. On the next day peace was concluded for the preſent on condition, That Prince <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the King of <hi>Romans</hi> Son, ſhould alſo render themſelves into the Barons hands. And now by this advantage the factious Lords, gained all the chief Caſtles of the Kingdom into their power, <hi>Montford</hi> carrying his Soveraign as his priſoner about the Country (yet with all outward reſpect and honour) the rather to procure a more quiet ſurrender of Garriſons. So fortunate may Treaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion for a time be, though in the end it commonly ſpeeds as it deſerves. To tame theſe Rebels the <hi>Pope</hi> ſends his Cardinal <hi>Legate</hi> to Excommunicate them, but they truſting to the temporal ſword, made light of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Howbeit, to the Kings great advantage there hapned ſo irreconcileable a difference betwixt the two great Earls of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> that the latter forſook the Barons cauſe, and joyned himſelf with <hi>Roger de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi> and his aſſociates, to whom not long

When the Prince having a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrength marched againſt <hi>Montford,</hi> who hearing of the Princes advance, encamped at <hi>Eveſham,</hi> where Prince <hi>Edward</hi> incloſed him, compelling him either to fight or yield. The firſt of which he elected, both Armies joyning battle before the Town of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> where the Earls hoſt was with much ſlaughter, eſpecially of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> utterly in the end diſtreſſed and diſcomfited. <hi>Symon de Montford</hi> being ſlain in fight, had his head, hands and feet chopt off. The King who had been brought a priſoner into the field, by his friends valour and good hap, was reſtored to his Liberty. And he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after this cruel battel called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> by whoſe approbation he ſeized into his hands the Charters of <hi>London,</hi> and other diſloyal Towns, diſinherited ſuch as were on the Earls ſide, diſtributing their eſtates amongſt his well-deſerving Subjects.

And now all things being calm in <hi>England,</hi> Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> with many of the Nobles, took the Croſs upon them for the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi> And the King to ſecure the Nations peace, held a Parliament at <hi>Marleborough,</hi> where the ſtatutes of <hi>Marleborough</hi> were enacted.

                     <hi>EDWARD</hi> ſirnamed Long-ſhanks at his Father <hi>Henrys</hi> death,<note place="margin">A.D. 1272</note> was imployed in the holy Wars, wherein he ſo excellently behaved himſelf, that he gained the repute of a moſt valiant Souldier. At <hi>Acon</hi> an aſſaſinate wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a poyſoned knife, which wounds his Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> daily licked with her Tongue, till therewith the poyſon was extracted and the wounds healed; her ſelf receiving no harm thereby. When the news of his Fathers death came to his ears, he grieved much more, than for the death of his Son, who died a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaying to the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> who wondred thereat, that the loſs of Sons is but light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are multiplied every day, but the death of Parents is irremediable, becauſe they can never be had again. At his arrival in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he was moſt joyfully welcomed, and with his deareſt <hi>Eleanor</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by <hi>Robert Kilwarby</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> When for the more royal celebration of the Coronation-feaſt of ſo Martial a Prince, there were five hundred great horſes let looſe, every one to take them for his own, who could. The firſt matter of remark done by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> after his Coronation, was the ſubduing of <hi>Wales,</hi> whoſe Prince <hi>Lewelin,</hi> the laſt Prince of <hi>Britains</hi> blood, had refuſed to do him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; but being ſlain his head crowned with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109115:112"/>
Ivie, was ſet upon the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> In his ſtead the King created his own ſon <hi>Edward,</hi> born at <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> And now <hi>Wales</hi> being ſetled in quiet, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired into <hi>France,</hi> where he ſate in perſon with the <hi>French King</hi> in his Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> as a Peer of that Realm, in reſpect of ſuch lands as he held in thoſe parts, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>England</hi> he addreſſed himſelf to purge his ſtate from the Oppreſſions under which it groaned. Fifteen thouſand of the extorting <hi>Jews</hi> he baniſhed out of the Land, confiſcating their goods. His corrupt Juſticiars he diſplaced and fined, and conſtrained all his Juſtices to ſwear that from that time, they would take no Fee, Penſion, or Gift, of any man, except only a breakfaſt or like preſent. He alſo appointed that Juſtices, Itinerants, ſhould go their ſeveral circuits at ſuch certain times of the year. And now the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, being deſtitute of any apparent Heir, by the umpirage of King <hi>Edward</hi> it was ſetled on the head of <hi>John Baliol,</hi> who did homage to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> (againſt the minds of the <hi>Scots</hi>) for the whole Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But ſhortly after <hi>Baliol</hi> to regain the affections of his people, combined with the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherefore the King advanced againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> with a puiſſant Army, drove the <hi>Scots</hi> out of the North-parts of <hi>England,</hi> where they had done much miſchief, took <hi>Berwick</hi> Town and Caſtle, had <hi>Dunbar</hi> yielded to him, and after a cruel fight, obtained a victory of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,

And accordingly the Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at a Parliament holden at <hi>Berwick,</hi> did ſwear to be true Subjects to <hi>Edward</hi> for ever after, and hereof a ſolemn Inſtrument was there ſealed by them. <hi>John</hi> the late King was ſent to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and the cuſtody of <hi>Scotland</hi> was committed to <hi>John de Warren</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Suſſex.</hi> Out of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough Edward</hi> took the Crown, Scepter and Cloth of State.

After which victory King <hi>Edward</hi> took ſundry places in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then returned into <hi>England,</hi> where in Parliament holden at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Stamford,</hi> he confirmed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi> and yielded that there ſhould be no Subſidy, or Taxation levied upon the people; without conſent of the Prelates, Peers and people. And for the more ample ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſome then diſcontented, he left out this Clauſe in the end of his Grants, <hi>Salvo jure Coronae noſtrae,</hi> Saving the right of our Crown; upon the <hi>Popes</hi> requeſt he ſet <hi>John</hi> late King of <hi>Scotland</hi> at liberty, who departed into <hi>France.</hi> And then the King made it his

whole affair to finiſh the annexation of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to which end,<note place="margin">Rob. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelſey. <hi>A. B.</hi> Cant.</note> he paſſed with a dreadful Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> not being able to withſtand him by force of Arms, they procured inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitory Letters from the <hi>Pope;</hi> but theſe the King ſet light by, ſwearing <hi>per ſanguinem Dei,</hi> that he would not deſiſt. And when the <hi>Scots</hi> threatned that if he would not deſiſt his hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the <hi>Pope</hi> would take the matter upon him, the King with a diſdainful ſmile anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Have ye done homage to me as to the chief Lord of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and do ye now ſuppoſe that I can be terrified with threatning lies, as if (like one that had no power to compel) I would let the right which I have to go out of my hand? Let me hear no more of this, for if I do, I ſwear by the Lord, I will conſume all <hi>Scotland</hi> from Sea to Sea. To which the <hi>Scots</hi> replyed, that in defence of Juſtice, and their Countrys rights, they would ſhed their blood. Howbeit that the King might not ſeem altogether to neglect the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſent the Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> thither in juſtification of his proceedings, and at the inſtance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he granted Truce to the <hi>Scots</hi> from <hi>All-Saints</hi> to <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> But the <hi>Pope</hi> not long ſatisfied with this, directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the King in his martial proceeds againſt that Nation, wherefore the King in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by the conſent of the whole Repreſentative body of the Realm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a copious defence of his whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, with proteſtations firſt, That he did

not exhibite any thing as in form of judgment or tryal of his Cauſe,<note place="margin">Gualter Renold. <hi>A. B.</hi> Cant.</note> but for ſatisfaction of his holy Fatherhoods conſcience, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> required that the King ſhould ſtand to his deciſion for matter of Claim, the Earls and Peers (to whom the King wholly referred it) with one mind directly ſignified, That their King was not to anſwer in judgment for any rights of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before any Tribunal under Heaven, and that (by ſending Deputies, and Atturneys, to ſuch an end) he ſhould not make the ſaid truth doubtful, becauſe it manifeſtly tended to the diſinheriſon of the ſaid Crown, which with the help of God, they would reſolutely and with all their power maintain againſt all men. To the which they all (being an 100. Peers) ſubſcribed their Names, Dated at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> 1301.</p>

Over whom King <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed the valiant Lord <hi>Segrave Cuſtos;</hi> but notwithſtanding his valour the <hi>Scots</hi> diſcomfited him, and took him Priſoner, whom Sr. <hi>Robert de Neville</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued, as alſo the reſt of the priſoners without the loſs of one man of his own. When the report of this ſucceſs of the <hi>Scots</hi> came to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ears, he went in perſon with a great Army, piercing therewith through all <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Roxbrough</hi> to <hi>Cathneſs,</hi> being about three hundred miles, not an enemy appearing with power to obſtruct him, but all either ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him, or betaking themſelves with their Captain <hi>Walleys</hi> to the Woods and Mountains.

                     <hi>Gaveſton's</hi> exorbitances, the Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment procured, (though with no good-will of the Kings) that <hi>Gaveſton</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> ſhould be perpetually baniſhed, they gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King with a ſubſidy of the 20th part of the Subjects goods.

                  <p>This Conqueſt incouraged the <hi>Scots</hi> to make inroads into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Northern Counties where they made great ſpoil, ſome of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> joyning with them.

The judgment given againſt the <hi>Spencers,</hi> he procured to be reverſed. Some of the Delinquent Lords render'd themſelves to the King; others of them were apprehended; amongſt whom were the two <hi>Roger Mortimers,</hi> Father and Son, who were committed to the Tower. Howbeit the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in the North, reſolved with what forces he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, to fight for his ſecurity; againſt whom the King marched, and at <hi>Burrowbridg</hi> encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred him; where <hi>Humphrey de Bohun</hi> was ſlain with a ſpear from under the bridg; and the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> with other principal men, Barons and Knights, to the number of above ninety, were taken by <hi>Andrew de Herckly</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> afterward created Earl of that place. The Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> a few days after was beheaded at <hi>Pontfract,</hi> the Barons and Knights were drawn, hang'd and quarter'd. The Lord <hi>Badleſmere,</hi> who refuſed to let the Queen lodg at <hi>Leeds,</hi> was executed at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> Never did <hi>Engliſh</hi> earth at one time drink ſo much blood of her Nobles, as at this time in ſo vile a manner ſhed. One Earl and Fourteen Lords ſuffering death, moſt of them by the halter. But that this Tragedy of the Lords was exploited by others, and not by the Kings free inclinations, appears; for that when ſome of the Courtiers and Favourites pleaded for the life of one of a mean Family condemned for being engaged in the Rebellion, the King fiercely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109115:121"/>
                     <hi>A plague upon you for curſed whiſperers, malicious backbiters, wicked Councellors; intreat you ſo for the life of a moſt notorious Knave, who would not ſpeak one word for the life of my moſt near Kinſman, that moſt noble Knight Earl</hi> Thomas? <hi>By the ſoul of God, this fellow ſhall dye the death he hath deſerved.</hi> In <hi>A. D.</hi> 1322. King <hi>Edward</hi> marched with a mighty Hoſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence for want of Victuals he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a ſhort time after to return, without the honour of any atchievement, the <hi>Scots</hi> alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him at the heels, and ſo ſuddenly aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he was forced to leave his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Furniture for pillage to them. But by reaſon of the Interdict which the Pope had put the <hi>Scots</hi> under in favour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a truce was made betwixt the two Nations for thirteen years. Which being confirmed, <hi>Edward</hi> took his progreſs through the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and Marches of <hi>VVales,</hi> from whence the late ſeditions had their nouriſhments; there puniſhing many ſeverely. Amongſt the reſt, he cauſed <hi>Andrew de Herkly</hi> to be degraded, hang'd, drawn and quarter'd, for trayterouſly taking part with the <hi>Scots.</hi> Whilſt theſe things were acting, young <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> having corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Keepers, or potion'd them with a ſleepy drink, eſcaped out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> getting over into <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Spencers,</hi> Father and Son, one created Earl of <hi>VVincheſter,</hi> the other of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> behaved themſelves exceeding lordly, even to the Queen her ſelf, whoſe maintenance they abridg'd to advance their own wealth. Many Nobles that had been engaged in the Barons

But the Queen and diſcontented Nobles reſolve to clear themſelves of the <hi>Spencers;</hi> to which end the Queen procured aids out of <hi>Henalt</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and uniting them with the Barons forces, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt the King, who found but few friends, becauſe of the mortal hatred that the people generally did bear to the <hi>Spencers.</hi> The Queen lying with her Army at <hi>Oxford,</hi> cauſed the whole Univerſity to be called together: When in the preſence of the Queen, Prince, <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> and other Nobles, the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> preached to them from that Text, 2 King. 4.19, <hi>My head, my head aketh:</hi> Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the reaſons of the Queens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Army; concluding that an aking and ſick Head of a Kingdom was to be taken off, and not to be tampered with by any other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. The <hi>Londoners</hi> ſtood high for the Queen and Barons, cutting off the Biſhop of <hi>Exceſters</hi> head, whom the Queen had left Guardian of <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Tower</hi> they gained into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, proclaimed <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Eltham</hi> Cuſtos of the City and whole Land, ſet at liberty all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The Queen did the like throughout all the Realm; by her order alſo all baniſhed men were revoked, whereby no ſmall encreaſe was brought to the Barons Forces. From <hi>Oxford</hi> the Queen marched to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which ſhe beſieged and took, and therein <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> the elder,

whom ſhe cauſed without any form of trial to be cut up alive, and quarter'd, having been firſt at the clamours of the common people drawn and hang'd in his proper Armories. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate King being now forſaken of almoſt all his <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects, after much wandering, intruſted himſelf with the <hi>VVelſh</hi> (who ſtill lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him) lying hid in the Abby of <hi>Neath,</hi> till at length after much ſearch he was found out, and with him young <hi>le Spencer, Robert Baldock</hi> Chancellor, and <hi>Simon de Reading,</hi> were taken.

                  <p>So terrible a famine was in <hi>England,</hi> that upon St. <hi>Lawrence Eve,</hi> there was ſcarce bread to be got for ſuſtentation of the Kings houſehold, ſo great a mortality likewiſe accompanying this dearth, that the living were ſcarce ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bury the dead. In the time of ſcarcity the King ſet forth an Order, That Wheat ſhould be ſold in the Market at eleven ſhillings the Quarter, a fat Ox ſtalled or Corn-fed at 24. Shillings, a fat Hog of two years old at three Shillings four pence, a fat Hen for a peny, and 24 Eggs for a peny; but victualls thereby became ſo ſcarce in the Markets, that this Order was revoked, and the people left to ſell as they could.</p>

Shortly after this, peace was concluded with the <hi>Scots</hi> upon diſhonourable terms to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the procurement of the Mother-Queen, and her Minion <hi>Mortimer.

Thirdly, for that the proceſs of the twelve Peers in giving the Crown from him when he was under age, was by all Laws void, and fruſtrate. Fourthly, for that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> had invaded <hi>Aquitain</hi> which belonged to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and detained ſuch places as he had wrongfully gained therein. Fifthly, for that the ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> had aided the <hi>Scots</hi> in their riſing againſt him. <hi>Edward</hi> having done this, he next makes a confederation with the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low-Dutch</hi> and other Foreigners, then prepared a brave Army, his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

The North parts of <hi>England</hi> were grievouſly afflicted with the ſtroke of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and their miſery augmented by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads and outrages of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had now by ſurprize gained <hi>Berwick,</hi> which upon the ninth day after, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained by force. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1379, a Parliament was held at <hi>London,</hi> wherein for ſupply of the Kings wants, it was agreed, That the Commons or poorer ſort ſhould be ſpared, and the burden be wholly laid upon the abler ſort.

They burnt all the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Goods at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and defaced all the Writings, Rolls, Records, and Monuments of the Chancery, as having a ſpecial hatred to the Lawyers. <hi>Simon Tibald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> a worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Sir <hi>Robert Hales</hi> Lord Prior of St. <hi>Johns.</hi> and Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> they haled out of the Tower, where the King was in perſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed them on Tower-hill with great ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and rejoycings.

But theſe ſun-ſhine days laſted not long: For beſides the annoyances done to <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Scots</hi> at ſeveral times, and the <hi>French</hi> threatning an Invaſion, the worſt miſchief befel at home through the means of diſcontented and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits, who kindled a Civil War. The Laity took offence againſt the Clergy, becauſe the Archbiſhop had in Parliament refuſed to yeild to an unjuſt proportion of the Tax grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, to be laid upon the Clergy. And ſo far were the Commons and ſome Lay-Peers offended therewith, that they petitioned the King to take away the Temporalties from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical perſons; which he denied, ſaying, That he would maintain the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in the quality of the ſame ſtate, or better, in which himſelf had known it to be when he came to the Crown The diſplacing of Sir <hi>Richard Scrope</hi> Chancellor, was diſpleaſing to moſt men. The reaſon of his diſplacing was, becauſe he refuſed to paſs ſuch large gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal, as the King in his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful humour had granted to ſome Courtiers. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Kings over-freeneſs to the Queens Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> diſcontented many. The ancient Nobles they envied that <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was created Marqueſs of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> a Merchants Son, Earl of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and that the King had them in too great favour. Theſe were held for great grievances; nor would the Parliament grant the King any aids againſt his forreign foes, unleſs theſe Lords were removed and degraded. This the King
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109115:137"/>
could not well digeſt, but conſulted the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law concerning certain Articles of Treaſon, within the compaſs of which he might take the popular Lords. And at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Robert Triſilian</hi> Chief Juſtitiar, <hi>Robert Belk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nap</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas, <hi>John Holt, Roger Fulthorp,</hi> and <hi>William Burgh,</hi> Juſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; <hi>John Lockton</hi> the Kings Sergeant at Law: All ſubſcribed to certain Articles of Treaſon made againſt the Lords, which afterwards coſt them dear. Judg <hi>Belknap</hi> foreſaw the danger; therefore unwillingly conſented, ſaying, <hi>There wants but an Hurdle, Horſe, and Halter, to carry me where I might ſuffer the death deſerved. For if I had not done this</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I ſhould have dyed for it; and becauſe I have done it, I deſerve death for betraying the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the King and Lords prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the field; the Lords march up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> with an Army of about Forty thouſand men; againſt whoſe coming the King, not being able to match their power, ſhuts himſelf up in the <hi>Tower,</hi> whither the factious Lords, <hi>Gloceſter, Derby, Arundel, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Marſhall,</hi> ſend him word, That if he come not quickly to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> according to appointment, they would chuſe them another King, who both would and ſhould obey the Counſel of the Peers. Hereupon the King, though with no good-will, attends their Lordſhips pleaſure at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he yeilded to remove from about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Alexander Neville</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> the Lords <hi>Zouch</hi> and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> with divers others; and

amongſt them certain Ladies. Other of his friends were made priſoners. And at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which was ſhortly after, the Judges were arreſted as they ſate in Judgment, and moſt of them ſent to the Tower. <hi>Triſilian</hi> that had fled, being apprehended, and brought to the Parliament in the forenoon, had ſentence to be drawn to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in the afternoon, and there to have his throat cut, which was done accordingly. Divers other Knights alſo were ſacrificed to their revenge. The Duke of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and others had their eſtates confiſcated to the Kings uſe by Act of Parliament. This while the <hi>Scots</hi> invaded the North of <hi>England</hi> under the conduct of Sir <hi>William Douglas,</hi> whom <hi>Henry Hot-ſpur</hi> fighting with hand to hand, ſlew; but the Earl of <hi>Dunbar</hi> coming with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive number of <hi>Scots,</hi> took <hi>Hot-ſpur</hi> and his brother priſoners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1396, Peace was concluded with the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> being included therein. And in <hi>September,</hi> 1397, a Parliament called <hi>The Great,</hi> (for the extraordinary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Peers and their retinues which came thereunto) was held at <hi>London,</hi> wherein the ſanctuary of former Laws, and all particular Charters of pardon were taken away from <hi>Thomas Duke</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and others for their treaſonable practiſes; and all the Juſtitiars who ſtood for the King were cleared from diſhonour, and ſuch Articles as they had ſubſcribed were publickly ratifyed, and the offenders againſt them pronounced Traytors. <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109115:138"/>
on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> where at his death he utterly denyed that he was a Traytor in word or deed. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> confeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Traytor in open Court, was only bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> (whom, as the peoples darling, it ſeemed not ſafe to bring to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tryal) was ſecretly ſmothered with pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and feather-beds at <hi>Callis.</hi> The King at this Parliament created himſelf Prince of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and to his Eſcutcheon-Royal added the Armories of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; his Couſin <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> he made Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and advanced the Titles of many other Nobles. Not long after which, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> accuſed <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> for ſpeaking certain words to the Kings diſhonour, which <hi>Mowbray</hi> conſtantly denying, it ſhould have come to a combat within Liſts, but the King ended the controverſy otherwiſe, by baniſhing <hi>Norfolk</hi> for ever, and <hi>Hereford</hi> firſt for ten years, then for ſix only. In the year following the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> dyed, when the King unjuſtly ſeized upon the goods of that mighty Prince his Uncle, and determined to baniſh for ever his ſon the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> by his Fathers death. But whilſt King <hi>Richard</hi> was in <hi>Ireland</hi> to qualify a diſturbance there, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> lands in <hi>England</hi> with what forces he had, pretending nothing but the recovery of his inheritance. To him there repaired the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> his ſon <hi>Hot-Spur</hi> and Earl of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> with many others:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:109115:138"/>
Multitudes offering their ſervice to him, as pitying his calamity, and exaſperated againſt the King, becauſe to furniſh his <hi>Iriſh</hi> voyage he had extorted moneys on all hands, and had taken up carriages, victuals, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries without any recompence. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> with an Army of about ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand marched to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> beſieged the <hi>Caſtle</hi> and took it, and therein two Knights of the Kings Councel, <hi>Buſhy</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> whoſe heads were cut off at the requeſt of the rabble.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> whom King <hi>Richard</hi> had left behind him to govern <hi>England,</hi> could gain but ſmall aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> nor could the King at his return into <hi>England</hi> find many friends, therefore he betook himſelf to a parly with his enemies; the ſum of his demands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That if himſelf and eight more whom he ſhould name, might have Honourable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, with the aſſurance of a private quiet life, he would reſign the Crown. This was promiſed him: whereupon he put himſelf into the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> hands, who conducted him out of the <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where he was lodged in the Tower. And now a Parliament is ſummoned in the Kings name to be held at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in which Parliament King <hi>Richard</hi> was charged with the breach of his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Oath in thirty two Articles: His abuſe of the publick Treaſure, waſte of the Crown-Land, loſs of Honour abroad; and that at home he was guilty of Falſhood, Injuſtice, Treaſon againſt the rights of the Crown, and what not, that ambition and envy could invent

                  <p>In the very beginning of this Kings reign, one <hi>John Philpot</hi> a private Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> at his own charge manned out a Fleet to the Sea, for the guarding of both Land and Sea from the enemy; and was ſo ſucceſsful, that within a ſhort ſpace he took fifteen Ships of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fraught with Rich Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</p>
                  <p>By a Tempeſt were caſt away at Sea four Knights, and above a thouſand <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in their paſſage to <hi>Little-Britain.</hi> In the year 1392, the <hi>Londoners</hi> were ſo unkind to the King, that they refuſed to ſupply him with the loan but of a thouſand pound, and becauſe a certain <hi>Lombard</hi> offered to lend the ſame, they abuſed and almoſt killed him, for which the King took away their Charter. The year of Chriſt, 1394, was famous or notable for the deaths of many great Ladies, and amongſt the reſt of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> the Kings firſt wife, whom, it is ſaid, he loved to a kind of madneſs. In the ſame year that the King was depoſed the <hi>Bay</hi> or <hi>Lawrel Trees</hi> withered all over <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards reflouriſhed; and on the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> near <hi>Bedford</hi>-Town the River where it was deepeſt, did on the ſudden ſtand ſtill, and ſo divided it ſelf, that the bottom remained

dry for about three miles. Now flouriſhed Sir <hi>John Hawkwood,</hi> whoſe Chivalry had made him renowned through the Chriſtian World. Sir <hi>Geoffry Chaucer,</hi> Poet-<hi>Lawreat,</hi> now alſo lived.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Anne</hi> wife to King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, firſt taught <hi>Engliſh</hi> women to ride on ſide-ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, when as before that time they rid aſtride.

But now <hi>Henry</hi> ſeated in <hi>Richards</hi> Throne, uſed all the beſt means to retain the hearts of the people that ſided with him, and to weaken the oppoſite party, and withal ſent Ambaſſadors to forreign Princes to juſtify his unjuſt proceedings. But the King of <hi>France</hi> and people of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> would not allow of his pretences, and the Citizens of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> openly ſaid, That ſince the world began there was never a more cruel, unreaſonable, nor wicked fact done. That the good Prince was betrayed by faithleſs men, and that all Law was violated. In <hi>England</hi> were many that inclined and contrived to ſet King <hi>Richard</hi> again upon his rightful Throne, (though to ſeek a captive Kings deliverance doth commonly haſten his death.) The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Conſpirators were <hi>John Holland</hi> Earl of

                     <hi>Huntingdon, Thomas Holland</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Surrey, Exceſter,</hi> and <hi>Aumarl, John Monticute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury, Thomas Spencer</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Carlile.</hi> Their plot was to kill <hi>Henry Bullingbroke,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Henry;</hi> but before the time of intended execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was come, the whole conjuration was diſcovered. Many attempts the conſpirators made to effect the re-eſtabling of <hi>Richard,</hi> and amongſt the reſt, they procured one <hi>Maudlen</hi> King <hi>Richards</hi> Chaplain to perſonate his Lord, but this with all the reſt of their projects failed. The Towns-men of <hi>Cyrenceſter</hi> aſſayled and took ſome of the diſcontented Lords, and then cut off their heads, becauſe ſome of their followers ſet fire on <hi>Cyrenceſter,</hi> thinking that whilſt the Towns-men were buſied in quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire, they might ſet their Lords at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Commons in <hi>Eſſex</hi> took the Earl of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and cut off his head, in revenge of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſters</hi> death, which he had had a hand in.

And now King <hi>Henry</hi> to divert the thoughts of the people from his Predeceſſors Tragedy, prepared a puiſſant Army and marched with it into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he only did ſome hurt by waſting the Countrey, and then returned.

                     <hi>HENRY</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> whilſt he was Prince, did many things very incongruous to the greatneſs of his birth, For he and his wild companions would way-lay and rob his Fathers and his own Receivers. And when one of his ſervants was arraigned at the Kings Bench bar for felony, this Prince hearing thereof, poſted thither, commanding his Fetters to be ſtruck off, and he ſet at liberty; and when the Judge oppoſed him therein, commanding him upon his Allegiance to ceaſe from ſuch riot, and keep the Kings peace, he in a rage aſcended the Bench, and gave the Judge a blow on the face, who ſate ſtill undaunted, and boldly thus ſpake unto the Prince; <q>Sir, I pray remember your ſelf. This ſeat which I here poſſeſs is not mine but your Fathers, to whom and to his Laws you owe double obedience. If his Highneſs and his Laws be thus violated by you, who ſhould ſhew your ſelf obedient to both, who will obey you, when you are a Soveraign, or miniſter execution to the Laws that you ſhall make? Wherefore for this default, in your Fathers name, I commit you priſoner to the Kings Bench, until his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſure be further known.</q> With which words, the Prince abaſhed ſtood mute, laid by his weapons, and with obeyſance done, went to the Priſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:109115:145"/>Whilſt the King his Father was crazie, and kept his Chamber, he through the Princes wild extravagances, and ſet on by ſome Court-whiſperers, began both to withdraw his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to fear ſome violence againſt his own perſon from the Prince, which when young <hi>Henry</hi> underſtood, in a ſtrange diſguiſe he repaired to his Fathers Court, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many perſons of Honour. His garment was a Gown of blew Satten wrought full of eye-let-holes, and at every eye-let the needle left hanging with the ſilk it was worked with. About his Arm he wore a Dogs Collar ſet full of S's of Gold, the Tirets thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt fine Gold. Being come to the Court, he charged his followers to advance no further than the fire in the Hall, whilſt himſelf paſſed on to his Fathers preſence, before whoſe feet he fell, confeſſing his youthful faults, and juſtifying his loyalty to his perſon; declaring himſelf to be ſo far from any diſloyal attempt, that if he knew any perſon of whom his Father ſtood in any danger, or fear, his hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to duty, ſhould be the firſt to free the King of ſuſpition; yea, ſaith he, I will moſt gladly ſuffer death to eaſe your perplexed heart; and to that end I have this day prepared my ſelf both by confeſſion, and receiving the bleſſed Sacrament: Wherefore I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Grace to free your ſuſpition from all fears conceived againſt me with this dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the ſtab whereof I will willingly receive at your hands, and will clearly forgive my death. At which, the King melting into tears,

caſt down the naked dagger (which the Prince had put into his hand) and raiſing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Son,<note place="margin">Henry Chicheley. <hi>A.

                  <p>But notwithſtanding this Prince's youthful exploits, yet when he had attained the Crown, to begin a good Government, he began at home, baniſhing from his Court thoſe unruly youths that had been his conſorts, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them either to change their manners, or never to approach within ten miles of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And choſe worthy men for his Council of Eſtate, advancing his Clergy with Power and dignity. So highly careful was he for the execution of Juſtice, that himſelf would every day after dinner for the ſpace of an hour, receive Petitions of the oppreſſed, and with great equity would redreſs their wrongs. And ſo nearly did the death of King <hi>Richard</hi> touch his heart, that he ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to be Abſolved from that guilt of his Fathers Act. In the firſt year of his Reign at a Parliament holden at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was a Bill exhibited, wherein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made, That the temporal lands given to the Religious houſes and ſpiritual perſons for devotion ſake, were either ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, or diſorderly ſpent; Whoſe revenues (if better imployed) would ſerve for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Land and Honour of the King; For the maintenance of fifteen Earls, 1500 Knights, 6200 Eſquires, and 100 Almes-houſes for the relief of diſeaſed and impotent

people, and unto the Kings Coffers Twenty thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> By the Authority of this Parliament, an 110 <hi>Priories alien</hi> were ſuppreſſed, and their poſſeſſions given to the King and his ſucceſſors for ever. But to divert thoſe in Authority from ſuch like proceedings, projects were put into the Kings head for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>France</hi> his rightful poſſeſſion. <hi>Henry Chicheley</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſuggeſted that King <hi>Henry</hi> as the true Heir unto his Great-grand-Father <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was the true Heir to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>

And when the Ambaſſadors had had their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given them, the King ſent <hi>Antilop</hi> his Purſevant at Arms unto <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> with Letters of defiance; next made Queen <hi>Joan</hi> his Mother-in-Law <hi>Regent</hi> of the Realm, then drew his Forces to <hi>Southampton,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his followers there to attend him on ſuch a day.</p>

And the 15 day of the ſame Month he caſt anchor in the mouth of <hi>Seyn,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three miles from <hi>Harflew;</hi> where landing his men, he fell devoutly on his knees, deſiring Gods aſſiſtance to the gaining of his Right. Then made Proclamation, That on pain of death, Churches, Church-men, Women and Children, ſhould be ſpared from all violence. And after due encouragement to his followers, he made <hi>Harflew</hi> the firſt eſſay of his Fortunes in <hi>France,</hi> it being a Port conveniently ſeated upon the mouth of the River <hi>Seyn,</hi> and a ſafe entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his intended Conqueſt, as well for the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, as to hinder the paſſage unto <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> both which received Traffique by the ſame River.</p>
                  <p>This town of <hi>Harflew</hi> was ſurrendred to King <hi>Henry, Septemb,</hi> 22.

ſtakes in the Fords, and in places of advantage laid ſtore of ſoldiers to impeach his paſſage; conveyed all victuals out of the Countreys through which he ſhould go, and at <hi>Blanche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> where he purpoſed to have paſſed over the River <hi>Some,</hi> there the <hi>French</hi> had fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for which cauſe he marched by <hi>Worms,</hi> with intent to have paſſed the River at <hi>Port le Remy;</hi> but finding that alſo guarded, he kept along the River to <hi>Hargeſt,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marching on the other ſide. Therefore he ſtill marched on by the River ſide, till he came to <hi>Bathen-Court,</hi> where he got over his feeble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wearied Army, proceeding on his march till he came to <hi>Azin,</hi> or <hi>Agin-Court,</hi> which was upon <hi>Octob.</hi> 24, where the <hi>French</hi> in a field of advantage purpoſely choſen, had pitched their Banner-Royal, with an infinite Hoſt, exceeding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſix times in number, ſome ſay ten times.

And ſo bold were the <hi>French</hi> upon their numbers and great ſtrength, that they ſpent the night before the battel in Feaſts, triumphs, and ſports; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> more wiſely in preparing themſelves for the fight. When morning was come, the <hi>French</hi> took the field, preſſing who ſhould be foremoſt to this eaſie (as they thought) Conqueſt. Againſt whom (their greateſt ſtrength conſiſting in Horſe) King <hi>Henry</hi> commanded Two hundred ſtrong Bow-men to lodg in a low Meadow, where a deep ditch full of water, might help to ſecure them from the Horſe, and the buſhes cover them from ſight; having ſtakes alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and ſhod with iron at both ends, which they were appointed to ſtick ſlopewiſe in the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to remove them upon occaſion to guard them from the Horſe. This done, King <hi>Henry</hi> ranged his Hoſt, diſpoſing it into three Battels, placing his Bow-men on both ſides the Main, where the King rode himſelf richly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred, before whom the Royal Standard was born, and many other Banners in Warlike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Both ſides being in readineſs, they a while ſtood facing one another. But the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> reſolving to break his way through his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to <hi>Callis,</hi> or elſe to dye, with a cheerful countenance, and words full of courage, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated his followers to put forth their utmoſt powers, that after-ages might know what the

Lance, the Axe, the Sword, and the Bow, could do in the hands of the Valiant; and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever deſired Riches, Honours, and Rewards, here they were to be had.

Their Wings which aſſayed to charge upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were broken, and forced back for ſafety to their Main Battel, where they bred both fear and confuſion. And thoſe <hi>French</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:109115:149"/>
Troops which purſued the Archers (who gave back as if forced to flye) came on with their Horſes on the ſpur upon the jaws of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for falling by multitudes on thoſe goring-ſtakes (left by the Archers on purpoſe) they were miſerably overthrown and panched to death, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtill on all hands hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their advantages. Againſt whom the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> advanced (hoping by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to encourage others) furiouſly breaking into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, wherein manfully fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was ſlain. With the like reſolution Duke <hi>Alanzon</hi> preſſed into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Battalion where King <hi>Henry</hi> fought, and there had ſlain <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had not the King come in to his reſcue, between whom and <hi>Alanzon</hi> was a hard conteſt, <hi>Alanzon</hi> giving the King a ſlighty wound, and the King at length ſtriking him down to the ground, whom the Soldiers in the heat of fight then ſlew, contrary to the Kings command. The <hi>French</hi> Reer-Guard ſeeing the diſaſter of their Van and Main Battel, to ſave themſelves, ran away, leaving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> no more work to do. The number of priſoners taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here was very great. But King <hi>Henry</hi> perceiving freſh troops of the King of <hi>Sicils</hi> to appear freſh in the field, and the ſame ſtrong enough without any new rallied forces to encounter with his wearyed Souldiers, to the end therefore that he might not have at once priſoners to guard, and an enemy to fight, contrary to his generous nature, he commanded that every man ſhould kill his priſoner, which was immediately done, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:109115:150"/>
principal men excepted. Then by his Heralds he commanded thoſe Troops either forthwith to come and fight with him, elſe to depart the field, either of which if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed he would revenge upon them without mercy. Whereupon they quit the field. When the fight was over and the field won, King <hi>Henry</hi> fell down upon his knees, and commanded his whole Army to do the ſame, ſaying that verſe in the Pſalm, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the glory.</hi> And demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was the name of the place, when it was anſwered him <hi>Agincourt,</hi> then to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities following, ſaith he, ſhall this battel be called, the battel of <hi>Agincourt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpoil here taken in Armour, Jewels, and Apparel, was very great. Of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſlain the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> two Knights, <hi>David Gam</hi> Eſquire, and twenty eight private Souldiers. Of the <hi>French</hi> were ſlain four thouſand Princes, Nobles, Knights, and Eſquires, and ten thouſand common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Priſoners of Account taken in the field were <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Richmond, Louis de Bourbon, Count de Vendoſme,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eu, Edward de Rouen,</hi> with divers others. Juſt before this battel of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> when it was reported that the <hi>French</hi> forces were very numerous, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gam</hi> reſolutely ſaid, That if there were ſo many, there were enough to be killed, enough to be taken priſoners, and enough to run away. The next day after this battel Great <hi>Henry</hi> marched towards <hi>Callis,</hi> and in the next
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109115:150"/>
month following ſpread ſails for <hi>England,</hi> and on <hi>November</hi> 23, in Triumph-wiſe he entred <hi>London,</hi> where he received the gratulations of his people. The City preſented him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in Gold, and two golden <hi>Baſons.</hi> After ſome time of refreſhing the King called a Parliament to <hi>London,</hi> which granted him a Subſidy, and a Tenth for the carrying on of his Wars in <hi>France,</hi> which he graciouſly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though it was too ſhort for the defraying ſo vaſt a charge.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to make it up, the King pawned his Crown to his Uncle Cardinal <hi>Beauford</hi> for a great Sum of Money, and certain Jewels to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> for ten thouſand Marks. Then with an Army of 25527, Souldiers, every fourth being an Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, beſides a thouſand <hi>Carpenters</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.</hi> Upon <hi>July</hi> 28, 1417, he took to the Seas; and <hi>Auguſt</hi> the firſt, arrived in <hi>Normandy</hi> to their great terror, many of the Inhabitants for fear flying into <hi>Britain.</hi> And as ſoon as on ſhore to encourage his followers, he dubbed 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knights, then laid ſiege againſt <hi>Conqueſt</hi> the ſtrongeſt Caſtle in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which he took <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſixteenth. He took likewiſe the Caſtles of <hi>Aumbelliers</hi> and <hi>Lovers,</hi> the firſt of which he gave to his brother <hi>Clarence,</hi> the ſecond to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and third to the Earl Marſhal. <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> the King took by force, giving the pillage thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Souldiers. Now whilſt King <hi>Henry</hi> was buſied in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> wrought what miſchief they could againſt him at home,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:109115:151"/>
entred <hi>England</hi> in an Hoſtile manner, bringing with them one whom they pretended to be King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, laid ſtrait ſiege againſt <hi>Roxbrough,</hi> and <hi>Berwick,</hi> but upon the report of an Army of <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming againſt them, they broke up their ſieges, and well was he that could firſt ſet foot in his own Country. In <hi>January</hi> the ſtrong Town and Caſtle of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> was delivered to the King, after which he divided his Army into ſeveral parts under the Conducts of the Dukes of <hi>Clarence</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who took ſundry gariſons. The King the while beſieged <hi>Roan,</hi> which after about a Twelve-months ſiege was delivered to him upon Terms, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Burgeſſes ſhould pay unto him three hundred fifty ſix thouſand Crowns of Gold; Should ſwear faith and loyalty to him and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1418. Immediately after the ſurrender of this, ſundry other places of Note yielded themſelves, wherein King <hi>Henry</hi> placed Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons. And now <hi>France</hi> trembling at the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ſucceſſes and their own loſſes, ſought a peace from King <hi>Henry,</hi> who yielded to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conference to be held at <hi>Melun,</hi> vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, his Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Katharine,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Count</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with a thouſand Horſe, came firſt; then King <hi>Henry,</hi> his brothers of <hi>Clarence</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> attended likewiſe with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, met them. When much conference paſſed, but nothing was concluded, which did not well pleaſe the King of <hi>England:</hi> wherefore
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109115:151"/>
ready to depart, he thus ſpoke to <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Couſin, I may not well digeſt this refuſal; but be ye aſſured, that either I will have your Kings daughter, and all my demands, or elſe I will baniſh both you and them out of <hi>France.</hi> You may ſpeak your pleaſure, anſwered the Duke; but before you ſhall thruſt us out of <hi>France,</hi> you ſhall be weary of the enterprize. The Treaty thus broke, <hi>Burgundy</hi> reconciled himſelf with the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed herewith, proſecuted the War more ſharply, ſet upon <hi>Ponthois</hi> the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> and in few hours gained the Town, wherein great ſpoils fell to the Souldiers ſhares. The news of this made King <hi>Charles</hi> to remove his Court from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Troys</hi> in <hi>Champagne,</hi> whilſt <hi>Henry</hi> went forward with his intended enterprizes, he and his Generals winning many ſtrong-holds. And to make the more way for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the <hi>Daulphin</hi> and his Mother the Queen fell at great variance, when the Queen by the procurement of <hi>Burgundy</hi> (the King being very infirm) was made Regent of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe female authority, and the hatred to her own Son the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> did not a little prejudice the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> And to the greater advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Daulphin</hi> killed the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> whereupon the Queen and young Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> perſwaded King <hi>Charles</hi> to diſinherit the <hi>Daulphin</hi> his Son, and to give the Lady <hi>Katharine</hi> in marriage unto the King of <hi>England,</hi> which accordingly was done, and a peace was concluded betwixt the two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The prime
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:109115:152"/>
Articles of the peace were theſe, That <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Iſabel</hi> ſhould retain the name of King and Queen, and ſhould hold all their dignities, rents and poſſeſſions during their natural lives. That after the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the preſent King of <hi>France,</hi> the Crown and Realm of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould with all rights and appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances remain unto the King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Heirs for ever. That becauſe of King <hi>Charles</hi> his infirmneſs and incapacity to diſpoſe the affairs of the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> therefore during his life the government thereof ſhould be and abide to King <hi>Henry;</hi> ſo that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he ſhould govern the Realm, and admit to his Councel and Aſſiſtance with the Councel of <hi>France,</hi> ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility as he ſhould think fit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Number of Articles were thirty three, which were ſworn unto at <hi>Troyes, May</hi> 30, 1420, the ſame being proclaimed in <hi>London,</hi> the 20 of <hi>June</hi> following. Theſe Articles were concluded betwixt the two Kings in the preſence of divers of the chief Nobility both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> homage being ſworn unto King <hi>Henry,</hi> and he proclaimed Regent of <hi>France.</hi> And on the third of <hi>June</hi> the marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Katharine</hi> was with all pompous ſolemnity celebrated at <hi>Troyes,</hi> the Biſhop of that <hi>See</hi> performing the ceremonies.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:109115:152"/>
the <hi>Daulphin</hi> was confirmed. In this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was alſo the final accord betwixt the two Kings acknowledged by the <hi>French</hi> King, as made by his free conſent and liking, and with advice of the Councel of <hi>France;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was likewiſe there ratified by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral States of that Realm, and ſworn unto particularly upon the Holy Evangeliſts by the <hi>French</hi> Nobles and Rulers ſpiritual and ſecular, who alſo ſet their Seals to the Inſtruments thereof. Which Inſtruments were ſent into <hi>England</hi> to be kept in the Kings Exchequer at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Things now ſetled in <hi>France</hi> as well as that unſetled time would permit, King <hi>Henry</hi> leaves the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> to be his Lieutenant there, and haſts for <hi>England</hi> with his Queen, whom he cauſed to be Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in little time after their arrival in <hi>England.</hi> Then called a Parliament in order to the raiſing of moneys for the continuing of the Conqueſt in <hi>France;</hi> but ſome men minding more their private intereſt than the publique, inſtead of being free thereto to contribute, they petitioned the King to commiſerate the poverty of the Commons, which, as they pleaded, were beggered by the Wars: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without further preſſing for any aid the King again pawned his Crown to his rich Uncle Cardinal <hi>Beauford</hi> for twenty thouſand pounds, and then returned into <hi>France</hi> with four thouſand Horſe and 24 thouſand Foot. And time it was, for the <hi>Daulphins</hi> party was grown conſiderably ſtrong by Aids ſent from <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the conduct of the Earl of

                     <hi>HENRY of Windſor,</hi> was crowned about the Eighth Month of his age.

The Regent himſelf fought moſt fiercely, winning unto himſelf a laſting Honour. On the enemies part was ſlain the Conſtable and Lieutenant of

                     <hi>France,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Wigton</hi> and <hi>Vantadour,</hi> with about five thouſand others. Priſoners taken, was the Duke of <hi>Alanzon</hi> himſelf, with about two hundred others of ſpecial account. After this Victory, the Regent beſieged <hi>Mants</hi> in <hi>Main,</hi> and with Ordnance beat down part of the Walls, whereupon it was yeilded; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Articles at the ſurrender (which perhaps might be upon every like occaſion) That if any perſon was found within the City which had been conſenting to the murder of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Father to <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgoigne,</hi> that they ſhould ſimply be at the Regents mercy.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, and not much, <hi>Thomas Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with a dreadful puiſſance, beſieged the City of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and ſo enforced it, that the inhabitants were willing to articulate, and to yeild themſelves to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> then being in his company: but the Earl highly diſdaining thereat, ſaid in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>I will not beat the buſh, and another ſhall have the bird.</hi> Which Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial ſpeech, 'tis ſaid, ſo offended the Duke, that it wholly alienated his mind from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to their great loſs in all the <hi>French</hi> Wars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.

fulneſs of his Fortunes. Then ſhe armed her ſelf like a man, and required to have that Sword which at that time did hang in Saint <hi>Katharines</hi> Church of <hi>Fierebois</hi> in <hi>Tourain;</hi> and being warlikely arrayed, ſhe gets into <hi>Orleans,</hi> which did greatly animate the fainting <hi>French.</hi> From <hi>Orleans</hi> this Maid of God (for ſo the <hi>French</hi> called her) ſent a Letter to <hi>de la Pole</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in words to this effect: <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>do reaſon to the King of heaven for his blood-royal; yeild up to the Virgin the keys of all the good Cities which you have forced,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am the chief of this War; whereſoever I encounter your men in</hi> France, <hi>I will chaſe them, will they nill they,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Virgin comes from heaven to drive you out of</hi> France; <hi>be not obſtinate, for you ſhall not hold</hi> France <hi>of the King of heaven, the Son of St.</hi> Mary, <hi>but</hi> Charles <hi>ſhall enjoy it, the King and lawful heir, to whom God hath given it.

                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1447, Good Duke <hi>Humphreys</hi> death was effected. He was much hated by the Queen and her party, as the only man who by his prudence, as alſo by the Honour and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his birth and place, ſeemed to impeach that Soveraign Command, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſettle in the King, but meant indeed (as the manner is under ſoft Princes) to reign themſelves in anothers name. Many great Lords were drawn on (at the time of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament then holden at St. <hi>Edmondsbury</hi>) to concur for his deſtruction, not perceiving that thereby they pluckt up the flood-gate, at which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould enter. This great
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:109115:158"/>
Duke being come to attend in this Parliament, was Arreſted of High Treaſon by <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Beaumont</hi> High Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Buckingham, Sommerſet</hi> and others; and to guard him certain of the Kings houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold were appointed: but it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was found dead, whoſe body was ſhewed to the Lords and Commons, as if he had died of a Palſey or Impoſthume. His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Sir <hi>Roger Chamberlain, Richard Middleton, Thomas Herbert, Arthur Turſey</hi> Eſquires, and <hi>Richard Nedham,</hi> Gent. were condemned of High Treaſon, and had this unexampled puniſhment. They were drawn from the Tower to Tyburn, there hang'd, let down quick, ſtript naked, mark'd with a knife to be quartred, and then a Charter of Pardon for their lives was ſhewed by the Marqueſs of <hi>Suffolk. Thomas Wild</hi> the Dukes ſervant alſo being condemned and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, had for a preamble in his Letters Patents words importing, That he had been one among many other Traytors againſt the King with Duke <hi>Humphrey,</hi> who went about, and practiſed to deliver <hi>Eleanor</hi> late wife to the Duke out of Priſon, for which purpoſe he had gathered a great power and number of men to come to the Parliament at <hi>Bury,</hi> there to have contrived the Kings deſtruction. Such was the end of this great Prince, who by the people of <hi>England</hi> was thought to be doubly murdered, by detraction and deadly practiſe. He was not only a true Lover of learned men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but himſelf was alſo learned and a Father of his Country. And now the whole frame of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:109115:158"/>
government ſeemed to repoſe it ſelf on the Queen, and ſuch Favourites as the King by her commendations liked.</p>
                  <p>The affairs of <hi>France</hi> were neglected. And the Duke of <hi>York</hi> perceiving the King to be ruled, and not to Rule, began ſecretly to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure his friends of the Nobility, and privily declared to them his Title to the Crown, as likewiſe he did to certain Governours of Cities and Towns. Which attempt was ſo politickly and cloſely carried, that his proviſion was ready, before his purpoſe was publick. The very ſtate of things invited this fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, there being now a milder King than <hi>England</hi> was worthy of, a Councel out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the people, manifold loſſes and diſhonours abroad, a turbulent and jealous condition of things at home. Of all which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> made his beſt uſe, cheriſhing the popular diſcontents, and inſtead of ſeeking to redreſs any evils in the State, he repreſented them to be worſe than they were, thereby to ripen that breach of Loyalty in the hearts of men, which his ambition wrought upon. In <hi>France</hi> matters went on very unhappily on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide; For the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> during the Truce, ſuffered a Town of <hi>Britain</hi> to be ſurpriſed, denying reſtitution thereof, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed his Souldiers in their riot and diſorders. The <hi>French</hi> therefore making this their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſurprized Town after Town till they had gained all <hi>Normandy,</hi> and within few years extorted the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> out of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> poſſeſſion.</p>

                  <p>About this time <hi>Adam Molins</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> and keeper of the Privy-Seal (a wiſe and ſtout man) ſtood in the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> way to the Crown; therefore he procured him to be ſlain at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> by certain Ship-men. And in a Parliament holden at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a principal pillar of King <hi>Henries</hi> ſafety, was ſet at again by the <hi>Yorkiſts.</hi> They charge that for a crime on him (namely the delivery of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Main)</hi> which themſelves had univerſally in a former Parliament aſſented unto and ratified. This they proſecuted ſo effectually, (though unjuſtly) againſt him, that he was condemned to be baniſhed for five years; but in his way to baniſhment he was by ſome imployed on purpoſe, taken at <hi>Dover</hi>-road, where they ſtruck off his head at the ſide of a Cock-boat: nor was his death much lamented of the people, becauſe he was thought to have been a private actor in the death of the Noble Duke of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> Now the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> having thus rid <hi>Suffolk</hi> out of the way, think it no unfit time to begin to put their deſigns in practiſe; ſo induce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

alſo were defeated by King <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Hegely Moor,</hi> where Sir <hi>Ralph Piercie</hi> dying ſaid, I have ſaved the Bird in my breaſt, meaning his Oath made to King <hi>Henry,</hi> in whoſe cauſe he loſt his life.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Hexam</hi> alſo were <hi>Henries</hi> forces defeated, but himſelf with much difficulty eſcaped into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Shortly after which, this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince came into <hi>England</hi> in diſguiſe, but being betrayed, was apprehended in <hi>Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington-Hall</hi> as he ſate at dinner, from whence he was conveyed to <hi>London,</hi> with his Legs bound to the ſtirrups, and at <hi>London</hi> was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and committed to the Tower.</p>
                  <p>And now King <hi>Edward</hi> thinks himſelf at leiſure to marry, yet refuſeth all Forreign matches, whereof he had many offered, and takes for his conſort an inferior ſubject, the Relict of his mortal enemy, Sir <hi>John Grey</hi> ſlain at the battel of St. <hi>Albans</hi> on King <hi>Henries</hi> ſide. This Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gray</hi> becoming a ſuiter unto the King for her Joynture; kind King <hi>Edward</hi> became a ſuiter unto her for a nights-Lodging; but ſhe wiſely anſwered him, when he became importunate, That as ſhe did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count her ſelf too baſe to be his Wife, ſo ſhe did think her ſelf too good to be his Whore. When the King would needs marry this Lady, to the great diſcontent of his Councel, but eſpecially of his Mother; His Mother alledged many reaſons to the contrary, and amongſt the reſt this, That only her Widow-hood might be ſufficient to reſtrain him, for that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:109115:166"/>
it was an high diſparagement to a King, to be diſhonoured with bigamy in his firſt marriage. To which the King pleaſantly anſwered, In that ſhe is a Widow, and hath already Children, By Gods bleſſed Lady I am a Batchelor and have ſome too, and ſo each of us hath a proof, that neither of us are like to be barren. And therefore Madam I pray you be content, I truſt in God ſhe ſhall bring you forth a young Prince, that ſhall pleaſe you. And as for the <hi>Bigamy,</hi> let the Biſhop hardly lay it in my way when I come to take Orders, for I underſtand that it is forbidden to a Prieſt, but I never wiſt yet that it was forbidden to a Prince. On <hi>May</hi> 26. 1465, was this Lady, whom <hi>Edward</hi> had accepted to be his Queen, Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with all due Celebrations. Her Father Sir <hi>Richard Woodvil</hi> was created Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> and made High Conſtable of <hi>England.</hi> Her ſon <hi>Thomas Grey</hi> was created Marqueſs <hi>Dorcet,</hi> and her other relations preferred. But this marriage of the Kings did ſo ſorely diſguſt the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had courted the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> daughter for King <hi>Edward,</hi> that he turned his affection from him to <hi>Henry,</hi> contriving all he could King <hi>Edwards</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. He wrought upon <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> the Kings brother to favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments, the Duke being the eaſier wrought upon, by reaſon he had before took offence againſt his brother about his Marriage, and preferring his Wifes kindred. Then did <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> by his Agents ſtir up a commotion in the North, one <hi>Robert Huldern</hi> firſt heading a rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of about fifteen thouſand, and he put to death, Sir <hi>John Coniers</hi> undertook the leading of them, marching with them towards <hi>London;</hi> Proclaiming, That King <hi>Edward</hi> was neither a juſt Prince to God, nor a profitable Prince to the Common-Wealth. Againſt theſe rebels the King ſent an Army that ingaged with them not far from <hi>Banbury,</hi> where the Northern men had gone off with the worſt, had not <hi>John Clapham</hi> Eſquire, a ſervant of <hi>Warwicks,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his colours with the white <hi>Bear,</hi> and from an eminent place cryed a <hi>Warwick,</hi> a <hi>ſVVarwick,</hi> whereat the <hi>VVelſhmen,</hi> fearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that <hi>VVarwick</hi> had been come, betook themſelves to flight, leaving their General the Earl of <hi>

The Earl with his brother Sir <hi>Richard Herbert</hi> were brought to <hi>Banbury,</hi> where with ten other Gentlemen they loſt their heads, <hi>Coniers</hi> and <hi>Clapham</hi> being their Judges, 1469.</p>
                  <p>From hence the Northern men under the conduct of <hi>Robin</hi> of <hi>Riddiſdale,</hi> haſted to the Kings Mannor of <hi>Graffon,</hi> where the Queens Father then lay, whom with his ſon <hi>John</hi> they ſuddenly ſurpriſed, and at <hi>Northampton</hi> ſtruck off their heads. The King this while having prepared a mighty Army, marched towards <hi>Warwicks</hi> company, and at <hi>Wolney</hi> pitched his Tents, the enemy lying at a little diſtance, in readineſs for battle; but by mediation of friends a peace was intreated. When the King reſting ſecure was by politick <hi>Warwick</hi> ſurprized in

In regard whereof, this Battel was called, the Battel of <hi>Loſt-Coat-Field. VVells</hi> with many others were put to death, 1470.

                  </p>
                  <p>And incredible it was to ſee the confluence of them which came armed to him, who a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before applauded and approved none but King <hi>Edward.</hi> The Baſtard <hi>Fawconbridg</hi> in the Weſt, and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where proclaimed King <hi>Henry</hi> alſo. And the Lord <hi>Montacute,</hi> who having muſtered 6000 men in the name of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and brought them forward almoſt to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> drew them back again, alledging King <hi>Edward</hi>'s ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to his friends. Every one cryed now, A King <hi>Henry,</hi> a King <hi>Henry;</hi> a <hi>Warwick,</hi> a <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick;</hi> and indeed all ſo applauded the paſſage now on foot, that King <hi>Edward</hi> was forced to flye beyond the ſeas. His Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſtole out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and took ſanctuary in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> where on the 4th of <hi>November</hi> ſhe was delivered of a ſon, which without all pomp was there alſo baptized by the name of <hi>Edward.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sanctuaries were alſo full of <hi>Edwards</hi> Friends. And now the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to rob, ſpoil, and do much harm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> and ſome in <hi>London</hi> it ſelf; and more would have done, had not the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> come in to the reſcue; which encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his name, that was great enough before. On <hi>October</hi> 6, the ſaid Earl entred the <hi>Tower,</hi> wherein King <hi>Henry</hi> had been detained priſoner
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:109115:168"/>
almoſt the ſpace of 9 years, whom he releaſed, and reſtored to him the title of King, and forthwith conveyed him through <hi>London</hi> to the Biſhops palace, where a pompous Court was kept till the 13 of the ſame month, on which day <hi>Henry</hi> went Crowned to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> bearing his Train, and Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> the Sword, the people crying, <hi>God ſave King Henry. November</hi> 26 following, a certain Parliament was begun at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein K. <hi>Edward</hi> was declared a Traytor to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, an Uſurper of the Crown, and had all his goods confiſcate; the like judgment paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his adherents. <hi>John Tiptoft</hi> Earl of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> was beheaded. All the Statutes made by K. <hi>Edward</hi> were revoked. The Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> entailed to K. <hi>Henry,</hi> and his Heirs Male, and for want of ſuch, unto <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was made Governour of the Land in thoſe turbulent times. But K. <hi>Edward</hi> having received ſome aids from the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of more in <hi>England,</hi> landed at <hi>Ravenſpur</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> At his firſt arrival, he ſeemed to lay aſide his claim to the Crown, pretending only to his rights as a private perſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, when he had poſſeſt himſelf of <hi>York,</hi> and got his friends about him, he then marched in an hoſtile manner till he came near to the City of <hi>Warwick,</hi> where his Brother <hi>Clarence</hi> brought in to his aſſiſtance 4000 men. And <hi>Clarence</hi> reconciled to K. <hi>Edward,</hi> ſought to draw in <hi>Warwick,</hi> to which end, he ſent meſſengers to him to the Town of <hi>Warwick</hi> where he then lay;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:109115:169"/>
but <hi>Warwick</hi> bade the Meſſengers go tell the Duke from him, <hi>That he had rather be an Earl, and always like himſelf, than a perjured Duke; and that ere his Oath ſhould be falſified, as the Dukes apparently was, he would lay down his life at his enemies foot, which he doubted not ſhould be bought very dear.</hi> This ſtout reſolution made <hi>Edward</hi> more wary, therefore he haſtens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to obtain <hi>London,</hi> whither when he was come, the Citizens ſet open their Gates to him. And now peaceable <hi>Henry</hi> becomes Priſoner again to K. <hi>Edward,</hi> who hearing of <hi>Warwicks</hi> advance towards <hi>London,</hi> draws forth his forces to meet him, taking <hi>Henry</hi> along with him, and upon <hi>Gladmore</hi> neer <hi>Barnet,</hi> on <hi>Eaſterday</hi> in the morning the Kings and Earls hoſts joyned Battel, the beſt of the day for a while being <hi>Warwicks;</hi> but at length through the foggineſs and darkneſs of the Air, the Stars embroidered on the Earl of <hi>Oxfords</hi> mens Coats, who were in the left wing of the Battel, were miſtaken for the Sun which K. <hi>Edwards</hi> men wore; in which error <hi>VVarwicks</hi> Battalion lets fly at their own fellows, that were in great forwardneſs of gaining the victory, and they not knowing the cauſe of the errour, judged themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed; whereupon the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> with 800 men, quit the Field: Which great <hi>VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> perceiving, he couragiouſly animated his men, and furiouſly ruſhed into the midſt of his enemies battel, ſo far, that he could not be reſcued, where valiantly fighting he was ſlain.

On King <hi>Edward</hi>'s part died the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Lord <hi>Bourchier,</hi> Lord <hi>Barnes</hi> and Sir <hi>John Liſle.</hi> On the other part, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and his brother <hi>John Nevil</hi> Marquis <hi>Montacute.</hi> On both ſides ten thouſand, moſt of which were buried upon the ſame plain, where afterwards a Chappel was built. In this ſame year 1471, and within few weeks after this was a battel fought at <hi>Tewksbury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King <hi>Edward</hi> and the Martial Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> the defeat hapning to the Queen; On whoſe ſide were ſlain <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Sommerſet, John Courtney</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> Sir <hi>John Delves,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Hampden,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Lewkner,</hi> with three hundred others.

How dareſt thou then, added the Prince, which art his ſubject diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play thy Colours againſt him thy Liege-Lord? Which anſwer ſo moved King <hi>Edward,</hi> that he daſhed the Prince on the mouth with his <hi>Gantlet,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> with ſome of the Kings ſervants, moſt ſhamefully murdred him at the Kings feet.

His accuſation was, That he had cauſed divers of his ſervants to inform the people that Mr. <hi>Burdet</hi> was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put to death, That upon purpoſe to exalt himſelf and Heirs to the regal dignity, he had moſt falſely publiſhed that the King his brother was a baſtard, and therefore not capable to wear the Crown, for which, and the like crimes charged upon him, he was in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Attainted of Treaſon, and found guilty, and on the eleventh of <hi>March</hi> 1478, after he had offered his <hi>Maſs</hi>-peny in the Tower, was drowned in a <hi>But</hi> of <hi>Malmſey,</hi> whoſe body was buried at <hi>Tukesbury.</hi> But the King was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much grieved, that he had conſented to his death, and would ſay when any made ſuit for the life of a condemned perſon, O unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate

                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1483, King <hi>Edward</hi> fell into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deadly ſickneſs, when calling for his Lords into his ſick preſence, and raiſing his faint body on the pillowes, he exhorted and required them all, For the love that they had ever born unto him, for the love that he had ever born unto them, for the love that our Lord beareth unto us all, that from that time forward all griefs forgotten, each of them would love other. Which, ſaith he, I verily truſt you will, If you any thing regard either God or your King, affinity, or kindred, your own Country, or your own ſafety. Shortly after which words he departed this life, <hi>April</hi> the ninth, and was buried at <hi>VVindſor</hi> in the New Chappel, whoſe foundation himſelf had laid. 'Tis ſaid of him, that he was juſt and merciful in peace, ſharp and fierce in War, and that never any King was more familiar with his Subjects than he. In the beginning of his raign he uſed to ſit in perſon certain days together in his Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to ſee juſtice and equity done. His Iſſue were <hi>Edward, Richard, George</hi> who died an infant, <hi>Elizabeth, Cicely, Anne, Briget, Mary, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret</hi> and <hi>Catharine.</hi> His Concubines were <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi> and three others, which were of three ſeveral humours as himſelf would ſay, One the merryeſt, which was <hi>Shores</hi> Wife, another the wilieſt, and the third the holieſt, <hi>for ſhe had wholly devoted her ſelf to his Bed and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:109115:171"/>
her Beads.</hi> His baſe Iſſue were <hi>Arthur</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Plantaginet</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ordained penal Statutes againſt exceſſive pride in apparel, eſpecially againſt long-piked ſhoes then worn, which had grown to ſuch an extream, that the Pikes in the toes were turned upwards, and with Silver-chains or Silk-laces tied to the knee. He gave ſome Cotſwold-ſheep to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> 1465, which hath been accounted one of the greateſt prejudices that ever hapned to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> One <hi>VValker</hi> a ſubſtantial Citizen of <hi>London</hi> was beheaded in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for only ſaying to his Child, That he would make him Heir of the Crown, meaning his houſe which had that ſign.</p>
                  <p>In the fallen eſtate of King <hi>Henry</hi> many of the Nobles that had took part with <hi>Henry</hi> were put to fly for their lives into Forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and amongſt the reſt <hi>Henry Holland</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceſter</hi> and Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> ſon to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſecond daughter of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and Husband to the ſiſter of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth, was conſtrained to live in exile in miſerable want and penury. For, ſaith <hi>Philip Comines,</hi> I once ſaw the Duke of <hi>Exceſter</hi> run on foot, bare-leg'd, after the Duke of <hi>Burgundies</hi> Coach and Train begging an Alms for Gods-ſake; But being known what he was, <hi>Burgundy</hi> gave him a ſmall penſion for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

But <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that theſe ſhould have the keeping of him ſecure, whom he deſigned to deſtroy, that thereby the Crown might become his. This bloody man therefore, the better to effect his wicked purpoſes, did every-where repreſent the Queens Kindred to be enemies to the ancient Nobility, and that they would abuſe the Kings Name to their undoing. With which, and like ſuggeſtions, he wrought upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (that had formerly born no great good-will to the Queens friends) to join with him, utterly to remove from the Kings company all his Mothers friends, under the name of the ancient Nobles enemies. Then the Hypocrite <hi>Gloceſter</hi> underſtanding that the Lords attending the King, purpoſed to bring the King to <hi>London</hi> to his Coronation, ſtrongly guarded, he therefore procured the Queen to be brought in mind, That it was not needful, but would be jeopardous for the King to be brought up ſtrong; for that if the Lords
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:109115:174"/>
of her Kindred ſhould aſſemble in the Kings Name much people, they ſhould give the Lords of the contrary Faction cauſe to ſuſpect, that this was not done for the Kings ſafety, whom no man impugned, but for the deſtruction of the ancient Nobility, by which means the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be brought into an uproar. The Queen thus over-reached, ſent ſuch word unto the King and his friends about him; ſo that they miſtruſting no guile, brought the King forwards with a ſmall company, in great haſte, but with no good ſpeed: For the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> at <hi>Stony-Stratford,</hi> as the King was on his way to <hi>London,</hi> took him by violence from his Friends, arreſted the Lord <hi>Richard Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Hawt,</hi> in the Kings preſence, and impriſoned Sir <hi>Anthony Woodvile,</hi> Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> in <hi>Northampton;</hi> whom in ſhort time after, with the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> they ſent priſoners into the North. Which done, with much honour and humble reverence they convey the King towards <hi>London.</hi> But the Queen hearing of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in great fright and heavineſs ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed her Childs Reign, her friends and her own miſhap, curſing the time that ever ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the gathering of power about the King; got her ſelf in all haſte poſſible with her young Son <hi>Richard,</hi> and Daughters, into the Sanctuary, lodging her ſelf and company, in the Abbots place at <hi>VVeſtminſter;</hi> whither the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> went to comfort her, telling her, he hoped that the matter was nothing ſo bad as ſhe doubted it; and that he was put in good
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:109115:174"/>
hope, and out of doubt, by a Meſſage ſent him from the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> (whoſe faithfulneſs to the King, he ſaid, none did or had cauſe to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect): <hi>Ah wo worth him,</hi> quoth the Queen, <hi>he is one that laboureth to deſtroy me and my blood.</hi> When the Archbiſhop was returned home, in the dawning of the day, he might out of his Chamber-window, ſee all the <hi>Thames</hi> full of boats, with the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s ſervants in them, watching that none ſhould go to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, nor none paſs unſearched. Great then was the commotion and murmur, as well in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places about, as eſpecially in the City, the people diverſly divining upon this dealing; and ſome Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, either for favour of the Queen, or fear of themſelves, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in ſundry companies harneſſed. But theſe commotions and fears were moderated by the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> then Lord Chamberlain, who perſwaded that the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was a ſure friend to the King, and that the Lord <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> with the others were for matters attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Dukes of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> put under arreſt; and that the King was bringing up to his Coronation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 4th, the King entred the City, and was lodged in the Biſhops Palace, where was held a great Council, and the Dukes of <hi>Gloceſter, Buckingham,</hi> and all the Lords, vvere ſvvorn to the King; and the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> vvas choſen to be Protector of the King and his Realm. And novv the Protector, to the end he might finiſh his deſigns at once, projecteth to get the young Duke of <hi>York</hi> out of ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:109115:175"/>
in order to which he pretends that the ſaid Duke only was a fit aſſociate for his brother the King, and that it was diſhonourable both for the King and thoſe about his Grace, that the Kings brother ſhould be fain to keep San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. But becauſe the Duke might not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Sanctuary by violence, the A. B. of <hi>York</hi> was therefore imploy'd to perſwade with the Queen to yield him up. This the A.B. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook (though perhaps not very willingly) alledging to the Queen the comfort that his ſociety would be to the King his brother, and that it would take off the obloquy of one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being afraid of the other, which would ſeem to be by the Dukes being kept in Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. The Queen deſirous to keep him where he was, pleaded his infancy, his being vexed with ſickneſs, inſomuch that ſhe durſt put no earthly perſon in truſt with his keeping but her ſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For though others (ſaid ſhe) haply might do their beſt to him, yet there was none that knew better than her ſelf how to order him, ſhe having ſo long kept him; nor was there any more like to cheriſh him than his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bare him. And to this her reply ſhe added many biting words againſt the Protector. Howbeit, in the concluſion finding by the A.B's words that the Protector would fetch her Son out by force, if otherwiſe he might not be had, ſhe deemed it beſt to deliver him, which ſhe did to the Biſhop and other Lords with him: ſaying to them, I deliver him, and his brother into your hands to keep, of whom I ſhal ask them both before God and the world. And to the

ſhe ſaid, Farewell, mine own ſweet Son, God ſend you good keeping, let me kiſs you once ere you go, for God knows when we ſhall kiſs together again; and therewithal ſhe kiſſed him, bleſſed him, turned her back and wept, and ſo went away, leaving the Child weeping as faſt. Then the Lords brought him to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, who took him in his arms, and gave him a <hi>Judas</hi> kiſs.</p>

                     <hi>June</hi> the 13, many Lords aſſembled in the Tower and there ſate in Councel, communing concerning the Kings Coronation, for the which Pageants were provided, and whilſt they were in conſultation in came the Protector about nine of the Clock, ſaluting them curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and excuſing himſelf that he came ſo late, ſaying merrily, I have been a ſleeper to day; then after a while departed, and about eleven of the Clock returned thither, but with a wonderful ſowr and angry countenance, knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his brows, frowning and fretting and biting his lips, and after ſome ſhort time ſaid, What are they worthy to have, who imagine and compaſs my deſtruction, that am ſo near of blood to the King, and that am Protector of his Royal Perſon and Realm? The Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> anſwered that they deſerved to be puniſhed as hainous Traytors, whatſoever they were, and ſo ſaid the other Lords. This is, quoth the Protector, yonder <hi>Sorcereſs</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wife, meaning the Queen, and that other Witch of her Councel <hi>Shores</hi> Wife, with their affinity, who by their <hi>Sorcery</hi> and Witchcraft have waſted my body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

with he pluckt up his doublet ſleeve to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, on his left arm, ſhewing a weariſh, withered arm, and ſmall as it never was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Whereupon the Lords minds much gave them, that this was but a quarrel.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit the Lord Chamberlain (who from the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> had kept <hi>Jane Shore</hi>) ſaid, certainly my Lord if they have ſo done they are worthy of great puniſhment. What, quoth the Protector, Thou ſerveſt me with Ifs and with Ands I ween, I tell thee they have ſo done, and that I will make good on thy body, Traytor. And therewith he rapt on the board with his fiſt, at which ſign given, one without the Chamber cryed out, Treaſon; Whereupon many men in harneſs came ruſhing into the Councel-Chamber, where they ſeized on the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> vvhom the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector bad ſpeed, and ſhrieve him apace, for by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid he, I vvill not to dinner till I ſee thy head off, vvhich accordingly vvas done, for he vvas preſently brought forth to the Tovver-green, vvhereupon a long log of Timber his head vvas ſtruck off. Thus ended this honourable man eaſie to beguiled. Novv the Protector to ſet ſome colour upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after he had dined ſent in all haſte for many ſubſtantial men out of the City into the Tovver, againſt vvhoſe coming thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and <hi>Buckingham</hi> his creature had harneſſed themſelves in old ruſty <hi>Briganders,</hi> as though ſome ſudden neceſſity had conſtrained them to put on ſuch Armour. And being come the Protector told them, that the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:109115:176"/>
                     <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and others of his conſpiracy had contrived ſuddenly to have deſtroyed him, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> there the ſame day in Councel, of the vvhich Treaſon he never had knovvledge before ten of the Clock the ſame Forenoon. And for the further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of the peoples minds concerning this Lords death, he cauſed alſo the ſame day an <hi>Herald</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi> to proclaim it through the City of <hi>London,</hi> That the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> vvith divers others had conſpired to murder the Lord Protector and Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſitting in Councel, and after to have taken upon them to rule the King and Realm at their ovvn plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. By and by after this he cauſed the Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> to repair to <hi>Jane Shores</hi> houſe, and to ſpoil her of all that ſhe had; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to put her to open penance for her former dalliance vvith his brother King <hi>Edward,</hi> and as 'tis ſaid, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited any from relieving her extream vvants. The Protector had alſo ſo contrived it vvith his <hi>Cabal,</hi> that the ſame day and about the ſame hour in vvhich the Lord Chamberlain vvas beheaded at the Tovver, thoſe Lords taken from the King at <hi>Stony-ſtratford</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi> ſhould be beheaded at <hi>Pontfract.</hi> Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly vvas done, in the preſence and by the order of Sir <hi>Richard Radcliffe,</hi> vvho at their execution would not permit them to ſpeak or declare their innocency.

the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> he vvins to his ſide. And the Mayors brother Dr. <hi>Sha</hi> (by the direction of the Protector and his Councel) upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>June</hi> 19th, at <hi>Pauls-Croſs,</hi> declared to the people that King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth vvas never lavvfully married to the Queen, and therefore his Children vvere Baſtards. Moreover that neither King <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf, nor the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> vvere reckoned (by thoſe that vvere of ſecrecy in the houſehold) for the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Children; but, ſaith he, as for the very Noble Prince the Lord Protector, he is the Fathers ovvn Picture, his ovvn countenance. At the time of the uttering of theſe vvords (according to the plot laid before-hand) the Protector ſhould have come in, to the end that thoſe vvords juſt meeting vvith his preſence, the people might have been the more affected vvith them; but vvhether by the ſlovvneſs of the Protector in coming, or the Doctors too much ſpeed, the Protector came not till theſe words were over: Nevertheleſs when the Dr. ſpyed his Lordſhip coming at laſt, he abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke off from the matter he was upon, to repeat the former vvords, This is the very Noble Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the people vvere ſo far from crying, King <hi>Richard</hi> (as it vvas hoped they vvould) that they ſtood as if they had been vvithout ſenſe, they vvere ſo amuzed at his ſhameful <hi>Harangue.</hi> And the poor Parſon vvhen he had done got him home, and there conſumed and pined to death in fevv days after. The Theme of his preachment vvas, Baſtard-ſlips ſhall never take deep root. On

the Tueſday follovving <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> made an oration to the Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and Commons in the <hi>Guildhall</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> wherein he aſperſed King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth as a Tyrant, his Children as Baſtards; endeavoured to prove the Protector to be the only true Heir to the Crown, perſwading the Citizens that they ſhould therefore joyn with the Nobility in Petitioning the Protector to take the Government of the Realm upon him, according to his very right and juſt Title. The next day the Mayor, Aldermen and chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners of the City reſorted unto the Protector to <hi>Baynards-Caſtle;</hi> whither alſo repaired <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> and other Nobles with many Knights and Gentlemen. When they were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Buckingham</hi> deſired the Protectors pardon and licence to acquaint his Grace with the intent of their coming, (as though he had not known it before) which in ſhort was to beſeech him to take the Crown and Government of the Realm upon him. At which words the Protector began to look angerly, withal denying to yield thereto. Whereupon his <hi>Privado Buckingham</hi> threatned, ſaying, That if he would not, they would find out ſome other man that ſhould, for they were reſolved that King <hi>Edwards</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage ſhould no longer Raign over them, and then <hi>Richard</hi> was pleaſed to accept the Crown as his juſt right, the people thereat ſhouting and crying, King <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Richard.</hi>

But the juſtice of God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Murderers, for <hi>Foreſt</hi> rotted away piece-meal, <hi>Tirrell</hi> died for Treaſon under <hi>Henry</hi> 7, and <hi>Dighton</hi> lived and died a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond beyond the Seas. And the Uſurper after this deteſtable fact, never had quiet in his mind, never thought himſelf ſecure; but when he went abroad his eyes ſtill whirled about, his body privily fenced, his hand ever on his Dagger, his ſleep interrupted with fearful dreams, ſometimes ſuddenly ſtarting up, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his bed and running about the Chamber. Immediately alſo after this Murder began the Conſpiracy betwixt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and divers other Gentlemen againſt the Murderer. The occaſion of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> falling off from <hi>Richard</hi> is diverſly reported: ſome ſay, it was becauſe the King would not grant him the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi>'s lands, to the which he pretended himſelf the rightful heir; others impute it to the Dukes high-mindedneſs, that he could not bear the glory of another. Himſelf ſaid the occaſion was the murder of the two Children. But be the occaſion what it would, yet this is moſt ſure that this enmity of the Dukes to the King proved of good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the rightful heirs to the Crown. For hereupon the Duke left the Court, retiring to his own houſe of <hi>Brecknock,</hi> where he had in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:109115:179"/>
his cuſtody that true friend to K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, <hi>John Morton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who by his wiſdom abuſed the Dukes pride to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, the Dukes deſtruction, and benefit of ſuch to whom the Crown of right apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. When the Duke was at firſt become alienated from the King, and come to his own houſe, he ſolicited the Biſhop his Priſoner to ſpeak his mind freely to him in matters of ſtate; but the Biſhop refuſed, thus anſwering him,
<q>In good faith my Lord, I love not much to talk with Princes, as a thing not all out of peril, although the words be without fault; foraſmuch as it ſhall not be taken as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meant it, but as it pleaſeth the Prince to conſtrue it. And ever I think on <hi>Aeſops</hi> tale, that when the <hi>Lion</hi> had proclaimed that on pain of death there ſhould no horned beaſt abide in the Wood; one that had in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head a bunch of fleſh, fled away a great pace. The <hi>Fox</hi> that ſaw him run ſo faſt asked him, Whither he made all that haſte, he anſwered, In faith I neither wot nor care, ſo I were once hence, becauſe of this Proclamation of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beaſts. What fool (quoth the <hi>Fox</hi>) thou mayeſt well enough abide, the <hi>Lion</hi> meant not thee, for it is no horn on thy head. No marry, quoth he, that wote I well enough; but what and if he call it an horn, where am I then?</q>
But though the Biſhop at the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined talking of State-matters with the Duke, yet afterward when by often diſcourſing with the Duke, and other circumſtances, he found him to be of a proud ſtomach, and emulated
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:109115:179"/>
the Kings greatneſs, he would ſpeak his mind frankly enough to him, rendring the Uſurper as odious as was poſſible, by alledging his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalneſs to his own Mother, in charging her with defiling the Marriage-bed, his unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his own Brothers and Nephews, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were baſtards, his murdering his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, and other enormities. Then to tickle the Dukes own ambition, the Biſhop would commend him to be a perſon of ſuch rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that he merited to wear the Crown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, inviting him for Gods ſake and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſake to take the Government upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or otherwiſe to deviſe ſome means how the Realm might be rid of the Tyrant, and brought under ſome good Governour. When the Duke had pondered a while upon this and the like diſcourſe of the Biſhops, he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Biſhop, That his reſolutions were to advance <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> to the Crown, and that the ſaid Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> heir of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſhould marry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, by which Marriage the Houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſhould be united into one. All which to effect, the Duke and Biſhop firſt made the Mothers of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> privy hereunto, and imployed divers truſty inſtruments to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the Nobles and Gentry in the deſign. Then the Biſhop left <hi>Brecknock</hi> in diſguiſe, and ſailed into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he did Earl <hi>Henry</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervices. Many great perſons combined to dethrone the Uſurper, which he having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of, ſent his loving Letters to the Duke of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:109115:180"/>
                     <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom he underſtood to be head of the Complotters, requeſting him moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come to the Court, for he was in great want of his wiſe counſel. But the Duke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting his ſmooth words, excuſed himſelf that he was ſickly and not well able to travel. The King therefore ſent his commands to him, and threats withal, if he refuſed to give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; unto which the Duke ſent his reſolute anſwer, That he would not come to his mortal enemy; and immediately prepared War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Then <hi>Thomas</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Dorſet</hi> came out of Sanctuary, and alſo gathered a band of men in the North, Sir <hi>Edward Courtney</hi> and his Brother the Biſhop of <hi>Exceſter</hi> raiſed another Army in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and in <hi>Kent</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Guilford</hi> and other Gentlemen raiſed a party, all which was done in a moment. But the Uſurper marching with his Hoſt againſt the Dukes forces, which were moſt <hi>Welſh,</hi> they for want of pay and other proviſion brake up their Camp, and left the Duke to ſhift for himſelf; which when the Confederates underſtood they alſo diſperſed themſelves. The Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> in diſguiſe repaired for ſecurity unto a ſervants of his near <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> named <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry Baniſter,</hi> but the King by Proclamation promiſing great rewards to him that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Duke, that wretch <hi>Baniſter</hi> for the hope of gain betrayed his Maſter the Duke. Who with a guard of men was conveyed to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where without arraignment or judgment the Duke loſt his head. Howbeit the Traytor <hi>Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> did not only loſe his promiſed reward, but
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:109115:180"/>
alſo received juſt puniſhments from Heaven; for his eldeſt ſon fell mad, and ſo died in a Hogſtie, his ſecond ſon became deformed and lame in his limbs, his third ſon was drowned in a ſmall puddle of water, his eldeſt daughter was ſtruck with a foul Leproſie, and himſelf being of extream age was found guilty of murder, but ſaved by his Clergy. Divers of the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi>'s party were put to death, and ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous was the King now of his ill-gotten great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he ſtored the Sea-coaſts with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of men, furniſhed the Ports with ſtore of munition, and made all things ready to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Earl <hi>Henry</hi>'s arrival; cauſed a Parliament to be aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein the ſaid Earl, and all ſuch as had fled the Land in his behalf were attainted, and were made enemies to their native Country, their Goods confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, their Lands and poſſeſſions condemned to the Kings uſe. Moreover the Uſurper ſent his Agents laden with Gold and many gay promiſes to the Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> offering what not if he would either ſend Earl <hi>Henry</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> or commit him there into Priſon; but the Duke himſelf lying extream ſick, his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer <hi>Peter Landoſe</hi> corrupted with Gold, had betrayed the Earl into <hi>Richard</hi>'s hands, had not the Earl had timely notice of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it by a ſpeedy eſcape unto the <hi>French</hi>-Court, where he received great favours Dr. <hi>Richard Fox</hi> then a Student in <hi>Paris</hi> was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to the Earl in that Nation. And the Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> when he underſtood the treachery of <hi>Landoſe,</hi> was highly diſpleaſed,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:109115:181"/>
and continued a favourer of the Earl and his Cauſe. But all theſe things with many more were againſt K. <hi>Richard,</hi> which he very well foreſaw, though he knew not well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: yet that he might make his Title and intereſt as good as he could, he deviſed to marry with his Neece the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but his Queen <hi>Anne</hi> ſtood in his way to this for the preſent, though not long, for ſhe fell into the remorſeleſs hands of death, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a natural or violent is not well known. After which <hi>Richard</hi> courts the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his own Brothers daughter, though in vain, for ſhe deteſted him. Howbeit when <hi>Henry</hi> heard of <hi>Richards</hi> attempts herein, and not knowing what time through flattery and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions from ſome perſons might do upon the young Princeſs her good nature, he haſtned for <hi>England,</hi> ſetting ſail from <hi>Harfleet</hi> with about 200 men, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 15, and arrived at <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> the ſeventh day following, from vvhence he advanced tovvards <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> On his way to which place there met him Sir <hi>Rice ap Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> a man of great command in <hi>VVales,</hi> with a great body of men to ſide in his quarrel, which Earl <hi>Henry</hi> afterwards requited by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this his firſt Alder Governour of <hi>VVales:</hi> From <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> the Earl marched to <hi>Newport,</hi> where Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> met him with two thouſand men from the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> Thence he paſſed to <hi>Litchfield</hi> where he was honourably received. But when the Uſurper underſtood that the Earl daily increaſed in ſtrengths, and that he was advanced ſo far,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:109115:181"/>
without any oppoſition, from his Court at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> he ſet forth his Hoſt to meet the Earl, which he did near unto <hi>Market-Boſworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> His Vant-guard he diſpoſed of a marvellous length, to ſtrike the more terror into the hearts of his foes, the leading where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was committed to <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> His own Battalion was furniſhed with the beſt approved men of War. When he had ordered his army for fight, he animated his followers to behave themſelves valiantly; alledging to them, that it was againſt a company of Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, Thieves, Outlaws, Traytors, beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Britains,</hi> and faint-hearted <hi>French</hi>-men, that they were to fight, who would oppreſs and ſpoil them of their Lands, Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; that theſe their enemies were ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that they would fly faſter from them than the ſilly Hart before the Hound; that the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> Captain of the rebellion was but a <hi>Welſh</hi> Milk-ſop. For their love to him their Prince, their zeal to their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he wiſhed them that day to ſhew their <hi>Engliſh</hi> valour, aſſuring them that for his part he would either triumph in a glorious victory, or die in the quarrel with immortal fame. Now S. <hi>George</hi> for us, and us for victory, ſaith he; Haſte therefore forward, and remember this, that I am he that with high advancement will prefer the valiant and hardy, and with ſevere torture will puniſh the daſtard and cowardly run-away. The Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi>'s forefront was commanded by the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the right wing by Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot,</hi> the left by Sir
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:109115:182"/>
                     <hi>John Savage,</hi> the main Battel by the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Uncle <hi>Jaſper.</hi> When the Earl had ordered his ſmall Hoſt, conſiſting of about 5000 men, he rode from rank to rank, and wing to wing, encouraging his followers to fight: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the juſtneſs of their quarrel, which God would bleſs; aſſuring them that for ſo good a cauſe as to free the Land of a Monſter, a Tyrant, a Murderer, he would that day rather become a dead carrion upon the ground, than a Carpet-priſoner kept alive for reproach. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance therefore forward, ſaith he, like true-hearted <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men, diſplay your Banner in defence of your Country; get the day and be Conquerors, loſe the day and be villains. God and St. <hi>George</hi> give us a happy ſucceſs. Then immediately a fierce Battel commenced, and was manfully continued on either part. At length the King having intelligence that Earl <hi>Henry</hi> was but ſlenderly accompanied with men of Arms, he therefore with his Spear in the Reſt ran violently towards the Earl, in which rage at the firſt brunt he bare down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Earls Standard, ſlew Sir <hi>William Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the bearer thereof, next encountred Sir <hi>John Cheiny</hi> whom he threw to the ground, thereby making an open paſſage to the Earl himſelf. In which very inſtant when the Earl was like to be diſtreſſed, the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> ſent in aids of freſh Soldiers (under the leading of Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi>) which were raiſed as he pretended for <hi>Richard,</hi> but intended them when he ſhould ſee his time for <hi>Richmond</hi>'s ſervice. Theſe entred the fight with ſuch courage that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:109115:182"/>
they put the Uſurpers forces to flight; when the Uſurper cloſing his Helmet ſaid to ſuch that brought him a ſwift horſe for his eſcape, This day ſhall finiſh all Battels, or elſe I will finiſh my life. So thruſting into the throng of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he manfully fighting died in the place, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1485, <hi>Aug.</hi> 22. There died with him that day the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ferrers of Chartley,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Ratcliff,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Braken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> The number of both parts ſlain in the field were 4000, Sir <hi>William Catesby</hi> with two other perſons of quality were taken, and two days after were beheaded at <hi>Leiceſter. Thomas Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> ſon and heir being then alſo taken priſoner, the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> demanded of him how he durſt bear Arms in behalf of that Tyrant <hi>Richard?</hi> to which he anſwered, He was my Crowned King, and if the Parliamentary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>England</hi> ſet the Crown upon a ſtock, I vvill fight for that ſtock. And as I fought then for him, I will fight for you when you are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the ſaid Authority. King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Crown which was taken amongſt the ſpoils of the field, the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earl <hi>Henries</hi> head. The ſlain body of the Uſurper all tugg'd and torn, ſtark naked was truſſed behind <hi>Blanch St. Lieger</hi> a Purſevant at Arms, like a Hog or Calf, the head and arms hanging on one ſide of the Horſe, and his legs on the other, after which manner it was brought to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> where it was buried in the <hi>Grey-Friers</hi> Church. The ſtone-Cheſt wherein his Corps lay, was at length made a
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:109115:183"/>
drinking trough for horſes at a common Inn. His body, if you will credit tradition herein, was born out of the City and contemptuouſly beſtowed under <hi>Bowbridge.</hi>

                  <p>His Iſſue was <hi>Edward</hi> dead before himſelf.

This ſcoffing Rhime was divulged in contempt of the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Richard,</hi> and his three principal Creatures:

the <hi>French</hi> King, and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> to ſtrengthen yet his enterprize, he repairs into <hi>Scotland</hi> unto <hi>James</hi> the fourth, (having ſpecial recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations from the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi>) who gave him moſt courteous entertainment. The rare impudency of the youth, and that connexion which his darings had with other Princes, drew this King into an errour concerning him.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:109115:187"/>
that the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> needed not to have taken theſe courſes againſt him had he been a feigned perſon. That the truth of his manifeſt cauſe had moved the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgundy</hi> his moſt Dear Ant, to yield him their aſſiſtence. That now, becauſe the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were wont to ſupport them, who were ſpoiled and bereft of the ſaid Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and for that he, the ſaid King <hi>James</hi> had given clear ſigns that he was of the like Noble quality and temper with his Anceſtors, he ſo diſtreſſed a Prince came to put himſelf into his hands, deſiring his aid to recover his Realms, promiſing faithfully, that when his Kingdoms were regained, he would gratefully do him all the pleaſure that ſhould lie in his utmoſt power.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Scots</hi> was ſo influenced with this Impoſtors words, amiable perſon, Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deportment, recommendations of Princes; his aids from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and aſſured hope of aid, in <hi>England,</hi> that he honourably received him, as if he had been the very <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and gave his conſent that this pretended Duke ſhould marry the Lady <hi>Katharine Gourdon</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he did, and alſo prepared to invade <hi>England</hi> in his quarrel, although there wanted not them, who with many arguments adviſed this King to repute him for no other than a Cheat.</p>

                  <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> heard of his landing, and making head againſt him, he ſmiled, ſaying, Loe we are again provoked by this Prince of <hi>Rake-hells;</hi> but leſt my people ſhould through ignorance be drawn into deſtruction, let us ſeek to take this <hi>Perkin</hi> by the eaſieſt way we can.

                  <p>About or in <hi>A. D.</hi> 1528, King <hi>Henry</hi> began to call into Queſtion the lawfulneſs of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> who was daughter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had been married to Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> (eldeſt ſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh) when he was about fifteen years of age, but he dying ere he had been married twelve months, King <hi>Henry</hi> his brother by the advice of his Councel took this Princeſs <hi>Katharine</hi> to Wife in few days after his Fathers death, and enjoyed her nuptial ſociety near
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:109115:195"/>
twenty years, in which time ſhe had born him two ſons, both dying in their infancy, and one daughter named <hi>Mary,</hi> afterward Queen. But now, he ſaid, his Conſcience was much diſſatisfied, doubting it might not be lawful for him to have his brothers Wife, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had had a diſpenſation from the <hi>Pope</hi> for it; therefore firſt he refuſed his Queens bed, and having moved the doubt to his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, he next ſent for the opinion of moſt of the Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> which concluded againſt it, and ſignified ſo much under moſt of their common Seals. He alſo ſent Agents unto <hi>Rome,</hi> with an humble requeſt to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that an indifferent Judge might be ſent to determine this weighty affair.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Cardinal Campeius</hi> was ſent over into <hi>England,</hi> with whom <hi>Cardinal Wolſey</hi> was joyned in Commiſſion. Theſe <hi>Cardinals</hi> had a place ordained them in the <hi>Black-Friers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for the keeping of their Court of Judicature. To which Court the King and Queen were ſummoned to appear perſonally, which accordingly they did, having ſeveral ſeats prepared for them. When the Court was ſate, the Cryer called King <hi>Henry</hi> to appear, who forthwith anſwered, Here; Then was the Queen called, who made no anſwer at all, but preſently roſe up, and going to the King fell on her knees at his feet, and in the audience of the people, ſaid unto him,
<q>Sir, I deſire you to take ſome pity upon me, and do me Juſtice, and right; I am a poor woman, a ſtranger born out of your Dominions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:109115:195"/>
here no indifferent Councel, and leſs aſſurance of friendſhip. <hi>Alas!</hi> Wherein have I offended, or what cauſe of diſpleaſure have I given you, that you thus intend to put me away? I take God to my Judge I have been to you a true and humble Wife, ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to your will and pleaſure, never gain-ſaying any thing wherein you took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Without all grudge or diſcontented countenance I have loved all them that loved you, howſoever their affections have been towards me. I have born you Children, and been your Wife now this twenty years. Of my Virginity and Marriage-bed I make God and your own Conſcience the Judge, and if it otherwiſe be proved, I am content to be put from you with ſhame. The King your Father in his time for wiſdom was known to be a ſecond <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> my Father accounted the wiſeſt amongſt their Kings, could they in this Match be ſo far over-ſeen, or are there now wiſer and more learned men than at that time were? Surely it ſeems wonderful to me that my marriage after twenty years ſhould be thus called in Queſtion with new invention againſt me, who never intended but honeſty. <hi>Alas,</hi> Sir I ſee that I am wronged, having no Counſel to ſpeak for me but ſuch as are your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and cannot be indifferent upon my part; therefore I moſt humbly beſeech you, even in charity to ſtay this courſe, until I may have advice and Councel from <hi>Spain;</hi> if not, your Graces pleaſure be done.</q>
Then riſing
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:109115:196"/>
and making low obeiſance to the King, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the Court; and though the Crier called her to come into the Court as ſhe was going away, yet ſhe went on, bidding her Attendant to go forward, and ſaying to him, This is no indifferent Court for me. When the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſhe was departed, he preſently ſpake thus unto the Aſſembly: I will, quoth he, in her abſence declare before you all, that ſhe hath been to me a moſt true, obedient and comfortable Wife, endued with all vertuous qualities and conditions according to her birth, and in lowlineſs equals any of baſer ſort. Which ſaid, Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> humbly requeſted the King, that he would be pleaſed to declare before that honourable Aſſembly, whether he had been the cauſe of this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Divorce, wherewith he was charged in the opinions of the people? Whereupon the King ſaid, My Lord Cardinal I can well excuſe you in this, and rather affirm, that you have been againſt me in attempting it thus far. Then by and by the Court was adjourned till <hi>May</hi> 28 following, which time being come the Kings learned Council alledged many reaſons and likelihoods to prove that Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> had nuptial knowledg of Lady <hi>Catherines</hi> body, as their being both of years capable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Act, he above fifteen, ſhe above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen, and both laid in one bed almoſt five months together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From day to day the Pleas proceeded, but nothing was concluded touching the Divorce, therefore the King ſent the two Cardinals to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:109115:196"/>
perſwade with the Queen to put the whole matter to himſelf, which he ſaid would be far better and more honourable for her, than to ſtand to the trial of the Law Theſe Legats ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly repairing to her, ſhe from among her maids at work came preſently forth of an inner room to them, having a skein of white thread about her neck to whom ſhe ſaid, Alack my Lords, I am very ſorry to make you attend upon me. What is your will? Madam, quoth <hi>Wolſey,</hi> We are come in good will to know your Graces mind in this great matter of your Marriage, and to give you our advice with the beſt ſervice we can. The Queen thanking them ſaid, That by order of holy Church, ſhe was eſpouſed to the King as his true Wife, and in that point ſhe would abide till the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (which was privy to the beginning) had made thereof a final determination and end. The King then hopeleſs of his Queens conſent, haſted his Lawyers to forward the Divorce, which daily they did; but when the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed was come for the final determination of the matter in queſtion, then Cardinal <hi>Campei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> reſerved it for the Pope himſelf to conclude. Which ſo enraged the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> that with a ſtern countenance he ſaid, It was never merry in <hi>England</hi> ſince we have had any Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals amongſt us. And Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> though he ſought to excuſe himſelf herein as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſufficient authority, yet did he fall under the Kings high diſpleaſure. The firſt ſtep of this great Prelates fall was his diſlike of the Kings affection unto <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> a Gentlewoman
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:109115:197"/>
nothing favourable to his Pontifical pomp, nor no great follower of the Ceremonies of thoſe times of Popery, which moved the Cardinal to write unto the Pope to defer the judgment of Divorce till he had wrought the Kings mind in another mould. Which was not done ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly but it came to the Kings ear, and proved to his ruin. For firſt the Broad-ſeal was taken from him, and ſome of his Biſhopricks, his houſe and furniture ſeized upon, and ſhortly after he was ſuddenly arreſted by the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> at <hi>Cawood</hi>-caſtle, (for arrogant words againſt the King, importing a deſire of revenge) from whence he was conveyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> in which journey at <hi>Leiceſter</hi>-Abbey he ended his life, by taking an over-great quantity of a Confection to break wind from off his ſtomack. So ended this haughty Cardinal, who was born at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> his father a good honeſt Butcher, himſelf a good Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and Orator. His education in his youth was at <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledg in <hi>Oxford;</hi> his firſt Preferment was from the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> who beſtowed a Benefice upon him. Then Sir <hi>John Naphant</hi> preferred him to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which King, having urgent buſineſs with <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, he ſent this his Chaplain to him poſt, who poſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain back before he was thought to be there, and withal concluded ſome points forgot in his directions, to the high content of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, for the which he beſtowed on him the Deanry of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> after which he was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the Kings Almoner, then one of his
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:109115:197"/>
Council, then Biſhop of <hi>Tourney,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then A.B. of <hi>York,</hi> whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as it were three Biſhops at once; then was made Prieſt, Cardinal, and <hi>Legat de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> then Lord Chancellor, and Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and in <hi>commendam</hi> the Abbey of St. <hi>Albans</hi> was beſtowed upon him. And with them the Cardinal held in farm the Epiſcopal Sees of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> enjoyed by ſtrangers incumbents not reſiding in the Realm. This Prelate raiſed to this greatneſs was attended with ſo many officers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as is incredible. And being Ambaſſador to the Emperour at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he was there waited upon by many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles, and ſerved at the Table by his Servitors on their knees. Inſatiable he was to get, but Princely in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing, lofty to his enemies, and not eaſily reconciled, which haſtned his fall when he began. The grudges againſt this Cardinal were not only for the eſpecial favour he ſtood in with the King, and great ſtroke he bare at the Council-table, but for his intolerable pillings, who to patch up his pride in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his new Colledges at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> ſuppreſſed forty Monaſteries of good fame, converting all their goods and moveables to his own uſe. As alſo that he emptied the land of twelve-ſcore thouſand pounds, inforced by him from the King, which he employed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ranſome the Pope then in Priſon, to the great impoveriſhing of his Majeſties Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. And laſtly his ſo intolerable pride, as no leſs than 1200 Horſe for his retinue, eighty

Which Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> hearing, ſaid, You might have better imployed it in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your debts. Truth my Lord, ſaid the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, you ſay well, for my Father owed my Maſter your Father three half-pence for a Calves-head, hold, here is two-pence for it. But now whilſt the matter of the Kings Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age hung in ſuſpence the ſpace of two years, it hapned that Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſaid, That the Kings cauſe would eaſily be determined by the Law of God, which the King hearing of put the Doctor upon the work, who thereupon penned a Treatiſe, therein proving by Scriptures, General Councils, ancient and modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no authority to diſpenſe with the Word of God, ſo as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto to grant liberty for a man to marry his brothers Wife. This he preſented to the King, which when the King had well read, he demanded of the Doctor if he would abide by what he had writ? That I will, ſaid he, by Gods Grace, even before the Pope himſelf, if your Majeſty ſhall ſo appoint. Marry, quoth the King, to him you ſhall go. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King ſent <hi>Thomas Bullen</hi> Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and other Divines to the Pope,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:109115:198"/>
who was then at <hi>Bonony.</hi> But when the day of audience was come, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> prepared to defend what he had writ, on the ſudden all was interrupted by an unmannerly Spaniel of the Earls, which ſeeing the <hi>Servus Servorum</hi> put forth his foot to be kiſs'd, caught his great Toe in his mouth, 'tis ſaid. But be it ſo or not, yet this is ſure, that there was no concluſion of the matter made by the Pope; therefore K. <hi>Henry</hi> reſolved to cut the <hi>Gordian</hi>-knot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without more ado; and withal began to call in queſtion what authority the Pope had in his Dominions, which being afterward deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Parliament, an Act paſſed againſt his uſurped authority or ſupremacy, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were prohibited from appealing or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any payments to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Kings Marriage with Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> diſſolved, and that from thenceforth ſhe ſhould be called only Princeſs Dowager. The Parliament made it appear that in forty years laſt paſt then, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had received from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom 160000 pounds for Inveſtitures of Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Divorce was under debate one <hi>Elizabeth Barton</hi> (commonly called the holy Maid of <hi>Kent</hi>) made a Votareſs in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was taught by <hi>Bocking</hi> a Monk to counterfeit many Trances, and in the ſame to utter many pious expreſſions to the rebuke of ſin, under which ſhe was heard the more freely againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Scriptures tranſlation then deſired by many. Alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth from God and his Saints, by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

pretended revelations, That if the King proceeded in his Divorce and ſecond marriage, he ſhould not reign in his Realm one month after, nor reſt in his favour one hour. But the impoſturiſme being detected, ſhe and ſeven of her complices were executed at Tyburn, for Treaſon, and others of them fined and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</p>

And repeating thoſe words very oft, ſuddenly with the ſword the Executioner ſevered her head and body, which were buried in the Quire of the Chappel of the Tower. Tis ſaid, that the Lord <hi>Rochford</hi> the Queens brother coming to her beds-ſide to ſollicite a ſuit, leaned thereupon to whiſper her in the ear, which the ſpials gave forth that he did ſo to kiſs the Queen. Moſt probable it is that the crimes which this Queen was charged withal were matters contrived by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> inſtruments, becauſe ſhe gave great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements unto many, more publickly and with boldneſs to profeſs the reformed religion, and procured a toleration for the Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.

D.</hi> 1540, and <hi>January</hi> the ſixth was King <hi>Henry</hi> married unto the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> but he refrained her bed, for the diſlike he had to her perſon; and ſhe good Lady, no other cauſe alledged, was divorced by Parliament the <hi>June</hi> following, when it was alſo enacted, That ſhe ſhould no longer be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Queen.</p>
                  <p>In this Parliament was <hi>Cromwell</hi> Attainted for ſetting at liberty certain perſons committed
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:109115:202"/>
for miſpriſion of Treaſon, and Hereſy; for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring and maintaining the Tranſlation of heretical Books (ſo called) into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for countenancing and ſupporting heretical Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for being an heretick himſelf, and for having ſpoken great words for the upholding his ſaid religion, to wit, That the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould not change it if he would. The cauſe why the King fell into diſlike of him, and conſequently of his ruin, was, becauſe he ſtood in the defence of the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> and ſpake not all well of the Lady <hi>Katharine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> whom the King was minded and did take to Wife. Which diſtaſt of the Kings againſt him, his enemy <hi>Stephen Gardner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> did improve to <hi>Cromwells</hi> deſtruction, who was beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and with him the Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> of <hi>Heitesbury</hi> for bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Margaret</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> daughter of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and Mother of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Reginald Pole,</hi> being neither Arraigned nor Tryed, but condemned by Parliament as <hi>Cromwell</hi> had been, was beheaded. And the Lord <hi>Leonard Grey</hi> about the ſame time loſt his head for Treaſon. And the next day after his death, <hi>Thomas Fines</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of the South died at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for killing a man in a fray. Nor was the Sword ſheathed until the heads of Queen <hi>Katharine Howard,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Jane Rochford</hi> were ſtruck off; the former for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the other for concealment, as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. The parties offending with <hi>Katharine Howard,</hi> were <hi>Francis Dereham</hi> and <hi>Thomas Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pepper,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:109115:202"/>
Dereham</hi> before ſhe was Queen and <hi>Culpepper</hi> after, who both were executed at <hi>Tyburn, Decemb.</hi> the tenth; and on <hi>Febru.</hi> the twelfth following Mrs <hi>Katharine Howard</hi> (for ſo in the Act of her Attainder ſhe is called) who had been Queen for the ſpace of a year and half, with the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> widow of the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> were brought unto the <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> where in lamentable paſſions they ſuffered death. This Queen proteſted after her condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Dr. <hi>White</hi> her laſt Confeſſor, that ſhe was guiltleſs, having never ſo abuſed her So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns bed.</p>
                  <p>But as theſe in caſe of Treaſon, ſo others in matter of Conſcience were put to death, by force of the Statutes made under this King. Whereof one was the renouncing the <hi>Popes</hi> ſupremacy, and owning the King for ſupream head of the Church in his own Dominions; this concerned the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> The other was the ſix Articles, this concerned the Proteſtants. Which ſix bloody Articles were,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That after the words of Conſecration there is no other ſubſtance conſiſting in the bread and wine, beſides the ſubſtance of Chriſt, God and man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Communion in both kinds was not neceſſary to Salvation, the fleſh only in form of bread being ſufficient to the Laity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Prieſts might not marry by the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the vows of chaſtity ought by Gods law to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:109115:203"/>Fifthly, That private <hi>Maſſes</hi> were neceſſary for the people, and agreeable to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That auricular Confeſſion was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be retained in the Church of God. For offending againſt the former Law of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was <hi>John Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> put to death, and Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> Lord Chancellor, ſo merry conceited a perſon that he could not forbear his jeſts though bloody death ſtared him in the face: For when on the Scaffold the Executioner deſired his forgiveneſs, he replied, I forgive thee, but I promiſe thee thou wilt get no hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides theſe two there were put to death for the ſame cauſe many <hi>Abbots, Priors</hi> and <hi>Friars.</hi> For oppugning the ſix Articles and aſſerting Goſpel-truths did many Chriſtians of the reformed Religion ſuffer death in the flames. Amongſt the reſt Dr. <hi>Robert Barns</hi> was one, and Mrs. <hi>Anne Askue</hi> a perſon of rare wit and elegant beauty, who when ſhe had been twice tormented upon the Rack to the disjoynting of her bones, then gave her body to the flames for Chriſts ſake. And the life of Queen <hi>Katharine Parre</hi> was hard laid for by <hi>Stephen Gardner,</hi> but through her wiſdom and prudent carriage towards the King, it was preſerved;</p>

His Mothers brother, <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Seymour</hi> Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> was by the conſent of the Nobles made Protector over his Minority, and the Realms.

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:109115:207"/>
Lords <hi>Yeſter, Hobby,</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Weems,</hi> and a brother of the Earl of <hi>Caſſills.

After the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors return a Parliament was aſſembled at <hi>London,</hi> wherein the ſix Articles were repealed, thoſe Colledges and Chappels that King <hi>Henry</hi> had left were given the King, and the Churches ordred to be purged of all Images. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Commiſſioners were appointed, who firſt began at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and thence proceeded throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> But this reformation occaſioned great commotions, which began in the Weſt. A Prieſt ſtabbed one Mr. <hi>Body</hi> a Commiſſioner to the heart, for plucking down certain Images; and this fact of his was ſo favoured by the <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire</hi> Ruſticks, that ten thouſand of them roſe in Arms, heading themſelves under Mr. <hi>Humphrey Arundel,</hi> ſix other Gentlemen, and eight Prieſts. Theſe rebells beſieged the City of <hi>Exceſter</hi> and ſore diſtreſſed it, yet did the Citizens loyally hold out againſt them; for which the King did enlarge their Liberties, and gave unto their City the Mannor of <hi>Exilond.</hi> At laſt the rebells agree upon Articles to be ſent the King, therein requiring to have Maſs celebrated as in time paſt it had been. To have holy bread and holy water in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts body and blood. To have the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:109115:208"/>
ſix Articles again in force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To theſe and the reſt of their demands the King ſent an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Therein pitying their ignorance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their ſawcineſs, and withal a general pardon to as many as would deſiſt in time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thus: <hi>We for our part ſeek no longer to live than to be a Father to our people, and as God hath made us your King, ſo hath he commanded you obedience; by whoſe great Majeſty we ſwear, you ſhall feel the ſame power in our Sword, which how mighty it is, no ſubject knoweth, how puiſſant it is no private man can judg, and how mortal no</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>heart can think. Therefore embrace our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whilſt it is offered, leſt the blood spilt by your means cry vengeance from the earth, and be heard in the ears of the Lord of Heaven.</hi> Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, the rebells ſtill perſiſted in their Traiterous attempts; the King therefore ſent an army againſt them, which put them to flight at <hi>Honiton,</hi> then worſted them at <hi>Exceſter,</hi> where the rebells lay ſiege, and laſtly upon <hi>Clift-heath</hi> deſtroyed the greateſt part of them; their conſecrated Hoſt, Crucifix, Croſſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Banners, holy bread and holy water (which the rebells had brought into the field, thinking by vertue of them to have made all ſure on their ſide) were all trampled into the dirt. <hi>Arundel, Winſland, Holmes</hi> and <hi>Bury,</hi> four rebell-Captains were taken and executed at <hi>London.</hi> Others alſo of their partakers were executed by Martial Law, amongſt whom was <hi>Boyer</hi> the Mayor of <hi>Bodmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwall.</hi> Nigh to which Town dwelt a Miller that had been a buſie-fellow in the rebellion, but he knowing
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:109115:208"/>
his own danger, willed his man to take the name of Maſter if any enquired after him. To this Millers houſe Sir <hi>Anthony Kingſtone,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of the Field came, where calling for the Maſter the officious man in his name very bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented himſelf, whom Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> ſtraight commanded to the Gallows; and when the poor fellow ſeeing the danger he was in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his note, confeſſing himſelf to be but the man, Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> ſaid, Well, thou canſt never do thy Maſter better ſervice than to hang for him, cauſing him to be truſſed up on the next tree. Other commotions aroſe in other parts of the Realm; but the moſt dangerous was that in <hi>Norfolk</hi> headed by <hi>Robert Ket</hi> a Tanner of <hi>Wimonham,</hi> who took upon him to be the Kings Deputy, giving out Warrants in the Kings name for what he pleaſed. His Tribunal-ſeat was in an old Tree, where ſate the jolly Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accompanied with his Counſellors and Aſſiſtants being two choſen men out of every hundred of the rout. Hither came the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Camp, and from hence Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were iſſued out to plunder Ships and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens houſes of Armour and Artillery; ſo that this Tree was termed the Oak of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whence likewiſe ſometimes Sermons were delivered, and once by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> for which his life was endangered, his Sermon was ſo diſpleaſing to the Rabble. To pacifie theſe rebells the King cauſed his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pardon to be proclaimed by an Herald at Arms. Notwithſtanding which they ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their rebellion, and made themſelves
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:109115:209"/>
Maſters of the City of <hi>Norwich.</hi> The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for ſent <hi>William Parre</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> againſt them, but him they over-powered. Then the Lord <hi>Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt them, who with ſmall reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance gained the Market-place of <hi>Norwich,</hi> where he cauſed ſixty rebells, whom he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, immediately to be executed by Martial Law. The main body of the rebells entrenched themſelves at the foot of the Hill called <hi>Duſſin-dale,</hi> partly upon vain Propheſies given forth amongſt them by Wiſards, That <hi>Hob, Dic</hi> and <hi>Hie,</hi> (meaning the Clowns) ſhould with their clubs fill up the valley of <hi>Duſſin-dale</hi> with dead bodies. On <hi>Auguſt</hi> 27, the Earl prepared for fight, the rebells likewiſe ſet themſelves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, placing in their fore-rank all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom they had taken priſoners coupled in Irons. Upon the rebells Captain <hi>Drury</hi> with his own Band and the <hi>Almains</hi> charged coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, and opened their Battel, to the ſetting at liberty of the captive Gentlemen, and the Earls light Horſemen came ſo valiantly on that the rebells gave back and fled, and with the foremoſt their Captain <hi>Ket.</hi> The chaſe held three miles and more with the ſlaughter of 3500 rebells. The reſt of the rebells that kept about the Ordnance, by the Generals perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and promiſe of pardon, caſt away their Weapons, and with one voice cried, God ſave King <hi>Edward.</hi> The next day following <hi>Ket</hi> was apprehended in a Barn where he had hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſhortly after was hanged in Chains upon the Caſtle of <hi>Norwich; William Ket</hi> his
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:109115:209"/>
brother was hang'd upon the high Steeple of <hi>Wimonham,</hi> and nine other of them were hang'd upon the Oak of Reformation. This Rebellion was at the firſt broacht under the pretence of throwing open the Incloſures, which the King by Proclamation had commanded to be done, though it was neglected. Theſe diſturbances being ſetled, others were made in the North by <hi>Thomas Dale</hi> a Pariſh Clark, <hi>William Ombler</hi> a Yeoman, and one <hi>Stevenſon</hi> the Poſt of <hi>Seymour.</hi> Their pretences were to reſtore the Church her rights, and to disburthen the Land of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; giving out that the Pope was the man, that K. <hi>Edward</hi> was an intruder, if not a meer Heretick, that the Church had power of both the Swords. When theſe fellows were increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the number of about 3000, the Kings pardon being ſent to them, they moſt of them departed to their own homes; but <hi>Ombler</hi> and <hi>Dale</hi> with four others were executed at <hi>York, Septemb.</hi> 21, 1549. And as the Commons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted the Country, ſo did ſome Lords and Ladies diſquiet the Court. The Protector's brother <hi>Thomas Seymour</hi> Baron of <hi>Sudley,</hi> High Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> had married Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine Parre,</hi> which Lady contending for place with the Protector's Dutcheſs, occaſioned the haughty Dutcheſs ('tis ſaid) to procure the Lord <hi>Sudley</hi>'s ruin. Which Lord was accuſed to have deſigned the getting of the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into his cuſtody, and Government of the Realm; for the which (with ſome ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters charged upon him) he was condemned by Act of Parliament and by his brother the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:109115:210"/>
Warrant was beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill, March</hi> 20. But the Brothers being now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, who might have ſupported each other had they lived together in brotherly love, the Protector himſelf is marked out for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Divers Lords article againſt the Duke, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him, That he had animated the rebells in their rebellion: That he was a ſower of ſedition amongſt the Nobles: That he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law erected a Court of Requeſts in his own houſe, inforcing divers of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thither to anſwer for their free-holds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo cloſe and cunningly they proſecuted the matter againſt him, that they got him into the Tower, <hi>Octob.</hi> 12, 1549, but the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his liberty immediately, though not his former Authority. In the mean ſpace that the Protector was under theſe troubles, the <hi>Scots</hi> recovered the places that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. The <hi>French</hi> alſo attempted to gain the Fort of <hi>Bulloinberg</hi> by ſurprize, unto which enterprize 7000 men were choſen, who ſecretly marched in the night with Ladders and furniture meet for the deſign, and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched within a quarter of a Mile of the Fort; but one <hi>Carter</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, a ſoldier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, underſtanding what was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, haſtily and privately made from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and gave the Alarm to his Countrymen in the Fort; whereupon Sir <hi>Nicholas Arnalt</hi> the Governour made ſuch preparations againſt the <hi>French</hi> mens coming, that at their approach he repulſed them with ſo great a ſlaughter, that fifteen Wagons went away laden with dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:109115:210"/>
of the <hi>French.</hi> After this the <hi>French</hi> aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Iſles of <hi>Garnſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> but were beaten off with the loſt of a thouſand men. Howbeit the <hi>French</hi> King gave not over till he had recovered by ſurrender <hi>Bulloinberg,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> which laſt he purchaſed at a high price.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1550, that mortal diſeaſe called the ſweating-ſickneſs raged extreamly through <hi>England,</hi> whereof died the two Sons of <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> both of them Dukes of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> ſucceſſively, beſides an infinite number in their beſt ſtrength. And, which is wonderful, this diſeaſe followed only <hi>Engliſh</hi> men in foreign Countries, no other people being infected thereby. And to fill up the dolours of theſe doleful times, the good Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> was again by the over-reachings of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> (lately created Duke of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and other his emulators, committed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and not long after put to death. For the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> giving ear to ſuch falſe friends as ſought his ruin, privily armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo went to the Council-Table, his flatterers having put him in fear of ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den attempt intended againſt him. But at the Council-Table his boſom being opened, and the Armour found, he was forthwith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as intending the death of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, and ſent to the Tower, <hi>Octob.</hi> 16, 1551, and in <hi>December</hi> following he was condemned of Felony, as ſeeking the death of ſome of the Kings Counſellors, and on <hi>Febr.</hi> 22 of the ſame year, he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:109115:211"/>
where he thus ſpake to the people: <hi>Dearly beloved Friends, I am brought hither to ſuffer death, albeit I never offended againſt the King, either in word or deed, and have always been as true and faithful to this Realm as any man hath been. But foraſmuch as I am by Law condemned to die, I do acknowledg my ſelf as well as others to be ſubject thereunto. Wherefore to teſtifie my obedience which I owe unto the Laws, I am come hither to ſuffer death; whereunto I willingly offer my ſelf, with moſt hearty thanks unto God, that hath given me this time of repentance, who might through ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death have taken away my life, that I neither ſhould have acknowledged him nor my ſelf.</hi> When having uttered theſe words with others exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory, That the people would continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the Goſpel, ſuddenly there was heard a great noiſe, whereby the aſſembly was ſtruck into great fear, which noiſe was made by ſome of the Trainband-Hamlets coming hurrying on the <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> This ſtir being ceaſed, another preſently inſued, for the people ſeeing Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Brown</hi> ride towards the Scaffold, they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ran and crowded together thitherward, ſuppoſing he had brought a pardon from the King, and with a ſudden ſhout, cried a pardon, a pardon, God ſave the King. But theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions over, the Duke proceeded in his ſpeech; requeſting the people to join in prayer with him for the King, exhorting them unto obedience to him and his Council. Which done, asking every man forgiveneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he freely forgave every man; he meekly ſubmitted his head to the Axe. Whoſe
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:109115:211"/>
death the people were much grieved for, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king very bitterly againſt the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and the good King ſorely mourned becauſe of it, which likely did much increaſe his Conſumptive diſtemper that brought him to his end. Whilſt he lay in his weakneſs he was over-wrought to diſinherit his two ſiſters <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to ordain by Will for his Succeſſor to <hi>Englands</hi> Diadem <hi>Guilford Dudley</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Jane</hi> the elder Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe Mother the Lady <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> was the Daughter of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles Branden</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Unto this Will of King <hi>Edward</hi> all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the Biſhops and all the Judges, ſaving Sir <hi>John Hallis,</hi> ſubſcribed. When the King drew towards his laſt breath, he prayed as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Lord God deliver me out of this miſerable life, and take me among thy choſen, howbeit not my will, but thy will be done. Lord, I commit my ſpirit to thee. O Lord, thou knoweſt how happy it were for me to be with thee, yet for thy Choſen ſake if it be thy will, ſend me life and health that I may truly ſerve thee. O my Lord, bleſs thy people and ſave thine inheritance. O Lord God, ſave thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen people of</hi> England. <hi>O my Lord God, defend this Realm from</hi> Papiſtry, <hi>and maintain thy true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that I and my people may praiſe thy holy Name, for thy Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake.</hi> So turning his face and ſeeing ſome by him, he ſaid, I thought you had not been ſo nigh. Yes, ſaid Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> we heard you ſpeak to your ſelf. Then ſaid the King, I was praying to God. O I am faint, Lord have mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:109115:212"/>
And in ſo ſaying he yielded up the Ghoſt, <hi>July</hi> 6, 1553. And was interred in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> He was a Prince very well learned in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, alſo in the <hi>French, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> adorned with the skill of Logick, Natural Philoſophy, Muſick and Aſtronomy. Of ſuch obſervation and memory that he could tell and recite all the Ports, Havens and Creeks belonging to <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> what coming in there was, how the Tide ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in every of them, what burden of Ship, and what wind beſt ſerved the coming into them. Of all his Nobles, chief Gentry and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates he took ſpecial notice of their hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and religious conventions. He was very ſparing of his Subjects blood though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, or hereticks. When <hi>Joan Butcher</hi> was to be burnt for hereſie, all his Council could not move him to ſign the Warrant for her executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> A. B. laboured with him therein; to whom the King ſaid, What my Lord, will you have me ſend her quick to hell? And taking the Pen he uſed this ſpeeeh, I will lay all the charge hereof upon <hi>Cranmer</hi> before God. So zealous he was for the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and againſt Popery, that he thruſt out all the <hi>Roman</hi> fopperies out of the Churches; and ſuperſtitions out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; nor would he permit his ſiſter <hi>Mary</hi> to have Maſs ſaid in her houſe, though the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> made ſuit for it in her behalf. So cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable that he conferred on the City of <hi>London Chriſts-Hoſpital,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas-Hoſpital</hi> for the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:109115:212"/>
relief of the Impotent, fatherleſs Children, and wounded Soldiers, and <hi>Bridewell</hi> for vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond and idle perſons; and ſo circumſpect as to himſelf and publick, that he kept a Journal-Book written with his own hand, how all things proceeded with him and the ſtate, even from the firſt day of his raign unto his death.</p>

                  <p>The Queen took her Chamber, the Court was full of Midwives, all due proviſions made againſt the good hour.

D.</hi> 1604, and <hi>Auguſt</hi> the nineteenth was peace proclaimed betwixt the two Nations of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And the King to joyn the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> into an happy unity, cauſed himſelf by Proclamation to be ſtiled King of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> A Proclamation alſo came forth commanding all <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prieſts</hi> out of the Land; but theſe under-miners of Church and State, mean not to leave <hi>England</hi> ſo, but deſign to ſtay and triumph in its ruins, purpoſing by one fatal-blow to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the King, the Prince, the Peers both temporal and Spiritual, the Knights, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>And the Traytors intent, when that damnable villany ſhould be effected was, to ſurprize the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:109115:234"/>
Queen, and remainder of the Kings Iſſue,<note place="margin">Richard Bancroft. <hi>A. B.</hi> Cant.</note> to bring in forreign powers and to alter Religion. Sir <hi>Edward Baynham</hi> an Attainted perſon was ſent to the <hi>Pope</hi> to acquaint him with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned <hi>Gun-powder-Treaſon,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> brought with him out of <hi>Flanders, Guy Fawks</hi> as a fit Executioner of their helliſh project. The Conſpirators reſolved among themſelves, that it was lawful for caſe of Conſcience to deſtroy the innocent with the nocent, and this by the Authority and judgment of <hi>Garnet</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Then they took Oath of ſecreſy, ſwearing by the bleſſed Trinity, and the Sacrament they then were about to receive, never to diſcloſe directly or indirectly, by word or circumſtance, this their Plot in hand, nor any of them to deſiſt from the Execution thereof, until the reſt of the Conſpirators ſhould give leave. This done, Mr. <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> hired an houſe next adjoyning to the Parliament-Houſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it to be for his Lodgings, and <hi>Guy Fawks,</hi> who changed his name into <hi>Johnſon,</hi> was to be his man, and to have the keeping of the Keys of the Houſe. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11th, 1604, the Traytors entred into their work of darkneſs, beginning their Mine, and by <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve</hi> they had brought their work under an entry unto the wall of the Parliament-Houſe, under-propping all ſtill as they under-mined. The wall which was very hard and nine-foot thick with great labour they wrought half-way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but then it hapning that a Cellar was to be let, which was under the Parliament-Houſe,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:109115:235"/>
they ceaſed their under-mining, and <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> hired the Cellar for the laying in of his Winter-fuel wood and coal. But inſtead of theſe, they ſtored it with thirty ſix Barrels of Gun-Powder, upon which they laid bars of Iron, logs of Timber, maſſie ſtones, Iron-crows, pick-Axes, with the reſt of their under-mining Tools, and, to cover all, ſtore of Billets and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots: So that now all was in readineſs againſt the next meeting of the Parliament. The ſecular Traytors had hitherto done their parts, nor were the <hi>Jeſuitical Prieſts</hi> wanting on their parts in doing their utmoſt. Their Maſſes and Sacrifices they uſually concluded with prayers for their brethrens good ſucceſs, ſupplicating their God to proſper their pains who laboured in his cauſe day and night, and that Hereſy might vaniſh away like ſmoke, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory periſh with a crack, like the ruin and fall of a broken Houſe: But through the goodneſs of the God of Heaven theſe <hi>Romiſh-Saints</hi> were taken, in the ſnare that they had laid for the juſt. They wrought their own deſtruction; For upon Thurſday in the evening ten days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament were to convene, a Letter directed to the Lord <hi>Mont-Eagle,</hi> was delivered to a Foot-man of his in the ſtreet, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known perſon, with a charge to deliver it into his Lords own hand. This Letter, without date or ſubſcription of name, ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legible and of ſtrange contents, perplexed the Lord; he haſtes therefore to <hi>White-hall</hi> there to impart it to the Lord <hi>Cecil</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> principal Secretary, who ſhewed it to the Lord
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:109115:235"/>
Chamberlain and other Lords, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it to the King. The Letter was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, <hi>Out of the love I bear to ſome of your Friends, I have a care of your preſervation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would adviſe you, as you tender your life to deviſe ſome excuſe to ſhift your attendance at this Parliament. For God and man have concurred to puniſh the wickedneſs of this time, and think not ſlightly of this advertiſement, but retire your ſelf into the Country, where you may expect the event in ſafety. For though there be no appearance of any ſtir,</hi> yet I ſay, <hi>you ſhall perceive a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they ſhall not ſee who hurts them. This counſel is not to be contemned, becauſe it may do you good, and can do you no harm, for the danger is paſt, ſo ſoon as you have burnt the Letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make good uſe of it, to whoſe holy protection I commend you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty after he had read this Letter, firſt pauſed a while; then reading it again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his judgment upon it; That he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by theſe words of receiving a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet ſhould not ſee who hurt them; That a ſudden danger by blaſt of Gun-powder ſhould be intended by ſome baſe Villain in a corner, no Inſurrection, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or deſperate attempt appearing. And therefore he wiſhed that the Rooms under the Parliament-Houſe might be throughly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which accordingly was done <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4th. about midnight, at which time Sir <hi>Thomas Kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi> went to ſearch thoſe under Rooms; Where
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:109115:236"/>
at the entrance into the Cellar he found <hi>Guy Fawks</hi> at ſo unſeaſonable a time, cloaked and booted, whom he apprehended, then entring the Cellar he found therein under the Billets thirty ſix Barrels of Powder; and when he came to ſearch the Traytor <hi>Fawks,</hi> he found about him a dark Lanthorne, three matches and other inſtruments for blowing up of the Powder. And the Villain no whit daunted, inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf guilty; but ſo far from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, That he vowed, if he had been found within the Room, he would have blown up himſelf and them all.</p>
                  <p>And when he was brought before the Lords of the Council, he lamented nothing ſo much, as that the deed had not been done, ſaying, That the <hi>Devil</hi> and not God, was the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of the Plot. But the news of the Plots diſcovery coming to the ears of <hi>Catesby, Piercy, Rookwood,</hi> the <hi>Wrights,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> they poſted into <hi>Warwick-ſhire</hi> to other of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, who now began an open Rebellion, pretending that all the <hi>Catholiques</hi> throats were appointed to be cut. And after that they had hovered about a while, they fled to <hi>Holbeth</hi> in <hi>Hereford-ſhire,</hi> whither they were purſued, and where <hi>John Wright</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Wright</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen making oppoſition were ſlain, and <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> and <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1607, was an Inſurrection in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter-ſhires,</hi> about the throwing down of Incloſures. At firſt the rout was without any particular head, but at length one <hi>John Reynolds</hi> undertook to be their Captain, affirming to the company, that in his great Pouch hanging by his ſide, he had ſufficient to defend them againſt all oppoſers; though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being apprehended, and his Pouch ſearched, there was nothing found in it but a piece of green Cheeſe.</p>

                  <p>About this time were many famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pirates, ſome of whom denied their faith and turned <hi>Turks,</hi> living in great ſtate at <hi>Tunis,</hi> as Captain <hi>Ward, Biſhop,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Verney</hi> and <hi>Glanvil.</hi> Nineteen of the Pirates were taken, and hanged at <hi>Wapping.</hi>

                     <hi>September</hi> 27th, the Lady <hi>Arbella</hi> the Kings Couſin-German died.

But Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> the Earls ſpecial friend having diſſwaded the match, and perhaps laid ſome imputation on the Ladies fame, according to deſert, did by this means ſo incenſe theſe Lovers againſt him, that they firſt made means to have the ſaid ingenious Gentleman commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to the Tower, and then by their inſtruments to have him poiſoned; ſome ſay, by a <hi>Tanſey</hi> ſent him to eat; ſome, by a Cliſter miniſtred to him. For which fact Sir <hi>Gervas Elwes</hi> then Lieutenant of the Tower, and Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> with others, were put to death. The Earl and his Counteſs were alſo arraigned and condemned, but had a leaſe of their lives granted them for ninety-nine years, yet ſo as after never to ſee the Kings face more. This made way for the advancement of Mr. <hi>George Villers;</hi> for this great favourite the Lord <hi>Carre</hi> being upon this occaſion laid aſide, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Villers</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in his ſtead.

ſentence was executed upon him. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> Viſcount St. <hi>Albans,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> was for bribery (but it was his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that were bribed) put out of his place, and committed to the Tower for ſome days.</p>

                     <hi>A.

Prince <hi>Charles</hi> about this time by great <hi>Gundamores</hi> perſwaſion, was ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> in order to the gaining of the <hi>Infanta</hi> to Wife, it being ſuggeſted that by that match with <hi>Spain,</hi> a re-ſettlement of the Prince Palatine in his Patrimony might have been procured. But when the Prince was arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> though he found Royal entertainment in the Court, yet was he ſuffered to have little acquaintance with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> inſomuch that in all his eight months ſtay in <hi>Spain,</hi> he never ſpake with her but twice, and that before company, with certain limitations alſo what he ſhould ſpeak to her. Some thought that a difference betwixt the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (then with the Prince) and Count <hi>Olivares</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> great Favourite, was no ſmall obſtruction to the match. Others thought that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> never intended any ſuch thing, but meant only by this Treaty to ſpin out time till he had compaſſed ſome deſigns in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and Palatinate. But howſoever it was, <hi>Gunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> made ſome good improvement of the

Treaty to himſelf; for he perſwaded ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ladies of the certainty of the match, and they gave him good Sums of money to be put in ſuch or ſuch an Office when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Princeſs ſhould come to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court. King <hi>James</hi> at laſt wearied with delaies, if not angred with the deluſion, ſent for the Prince to return, which accordingly he did; and not long after, this Treaty of marriage with <hi>Spain</hi> was utterly ended, and the King made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of men and money to recover the Palatinate, and ſent to Treat of a marriage with <hi>France.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth year of his age he was brought to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and made Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and inveſted with the Title of Duke of <hi>York.</hi> In his eleventh year he was made Knight of the Garter, and in his twelfth year Duke of <hi>Cornwal.</hi> In his ſixteenth year he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi> the revenues thereof being aſſigned to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Court.

to each other, when they have been found in an others Dominions. And this none other daring to mind the King of, his Jeſter <hi>Archee</hi> did it after this manner: He came to exchange Caps with the King; why ſo, ſaid King <hi>James?</hi> becauſe ſaid <hi>Archee,</hi> thou haſt ſent the Prince into <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence he is never like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.

                  <p>When the Prince was returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> a Wife was ſought for him from <hi>France,</hi> by a marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.

Prince <hi>Charles</hi> after the celebrating of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Funerals, whereat himſelf was chief Mourner, he next haſtned the coming over of his deareſt Conſort the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> had in his name eſpouſed at the Church of <hi>Noſtredame</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> and he receiving her at <hi>Dover,</hi> the next day after <hi>Trinity-Sunday</hi> at <hi>Canterbury</hi> began the Nuptial embraces.</p>

In this expedition many brave <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> loſt their lives, from which when the Duke was returned, thoſe poor remains of his Army, moſt of them <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> were billeted in divers villages of <hi>England,</hi> to the great diſcontent of the Country. This Epedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſo unhappy, and the miſeries of <hi>Rochel</hi> making them importunate for the Kings aſſiſtance, he therefore ſummoned a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to meet <hi>March</hi> 17th, 1627, He alſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Commiſſion under the great Seal to levy monies throughout the Nation by impoſitions in nature of Exciſe.</p>

Wherein was laid open the miſcarriages of many perſons in places of Truſt, with ſeveral ſorts of National grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. The firſt matter that the Parliament took into their conſideration, was the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Country, and the firſt grievance they debated was the Caſe of thoſe Gentlemen, who having refuſed the Loan, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This buſineſs took up a long debate and earneſt, which was chiefly managed by Sir <hi>Francis Seymour,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyard,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Philips.</hi> Next the Houſe proceeded to the drawing up of a Petition againſt <hi>Recuſants,</hi> to which Petition the King gave a ſatisfactory anſwer. Then after the granting of the King five Subſidies, they took into debate the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right, wherein they prayed his Moſt Excellent Majeſty,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That no man hereafter be compelled to make or yield any Gift, Loan, Benevolence, Tax, or ſuch like charge, without common conſent by Act of Parliament; and that none be called to make anſwer, or to take ſuch Oath, or to give attendance, or be confined, or otherwiſe moleſted concerning the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That no Free-man be taken and impriſoned, or be diſſeized of his freedom or liberty, or his free-cuſtomes, or be out-lawed,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:109115:245"/>
or exiled, but by the lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Souldiers and Mariners now billeted in divers Counties, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the people not be burdened ſo in the future.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the late Commiſſions for proceeding by Martial-Law might be revoked and annulled, and that hereafter no Commiſſion of like nature might be iſſued forth. To all which the King at laſt yielded his conſent; ſending this anſwer to the Parliament, <hi>Soit droit fait comme il eſt deſirèe.</hi> And to the peoples further ſatisfaction, his Majeſty received into his favour the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhop of Lincoln, the Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Lincoln, Warwick, Briſtol,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Say.</hi>

                  <p>About this time Dr. <hi>Lamb</hi> a favourite of the Dukes, and ſuppoſed <hi>Necromancer,</hi> was killed in <hi>London</hi> by the rout of the people, who hated him both for his own ſake and the Dukes, <hi>A.

Then another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was agreed on, and a more formidable
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:109115:246"/>
Fleet was prepared; but as the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> was at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> haſtning his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Sea, he was ſuddenly ſtab'd by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Felton,</hi> who after his apprehenſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded what invited him to the bloody fact, boldly anſwered, That he killed him for the Cauſe of God and his Country.

                  <p>In the Dukes place the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> an excellent Souldier was ſent for the aid of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who after ſome valiant yet fruitleſs attempts returned into <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> to the obedience of the <hi>French</hi> King.

                  <p>
                     <hi>January</hi> 20th, the Parliament aſſembled again, when they prepared a Bill againſt Tonnage and Poundage, and the Commons made a Proteſtation amongſt themſelves, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould ſeek to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme,</hi> or other opinions diſagreeing from the true and Orthodox Church, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a Capital enemy to the Commonwealth, That whoſoever ſhould counſel or adviſe the taking or levying the Subſidies of Tonnage or Poundage, not being granted in Parliament, or ſhould be an Actor or Inſtrument therein, ſhould likewiſe be reputed an enemy to the Commonwealth; or whoſoever ſhould volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily pay the ſame not being granted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſhould be reputed a betrayer of the Liberties, and an enemy of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

Hereupon his Majeſty preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Parliament.

As ſoon as the Coronation-Rites were accompliſhed, the King ſummoned a Parliament, and paſt an Act for the ratification of all thoſe Laws that King <hi>James</hi> had made in that Nation, for the better regulation of that Church, both as to the Government and Worſhip of it.

Nor was it the rabble only, that were diſaffected to the Church-Liturgy and Diſcipline, but perſons of all degrees and orders, who mutually obliged themſelves, and the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, in a Helliſh Covenant to extirpate Epiſcopacy, and to defend each other againſt all perſons. To reduce this People to a more peaceful practice, the King ſent Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton</hi> as his Commiſſioner; but there were new ſeeds of diſcontents and war dayly ſown: ſo that to pacific the diſcontents of the <hi>Scots,</hi> his Majeſty at length gave order for revoking the Liturgy, the High-Commiſſion, the Book of Canons, and the five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> made by King <hi>James,</hi> alſo granted that a general aſſembly of the <hi>Kirk</hi> ſhould be holden at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> Novem. 21. 1638. and a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> 15 of <hi>May</hi> 1639.</p>

                     <hi>A.

His Majeſty hereupon calls a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England</hi> to ſit, <hi>April</hi> 13, 1640. and another in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Parliament grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money to raiſe and pay 8000 men in Arms, and to furniſh them with ammunition; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament were not ſo free in granting ſupplies againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> although the King promiſed them for ever to quit his claim of Ship-money, and give ſatisfaction to their juſt demands, if now they would ſupply him. When his Majeſty ſent old Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> unto them to demand ſix ſubſidies, he either purpoſely or accidentally (the firſt is rather thought) named twelve, which put the Commons into ſuch a heat, that they were about to remonſtrate againſt the War with <hi>Scotland.</hi> Whereupon the King was forced to diſſolve the Parliament, <hi>May</hi> the 5. 1640. Howbeit he continued the Convocation of the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:109115:249"/>
Clergy, which granted him four ſhillings in the pound for all their Eccleſiaſtical promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Soon after this, a tumult was ſtirr'd up at the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury's;</hi> inſomuch that a great number of Apprentices and vulgar perſons aſſaulted his houſe at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> ſome of whom being apprehended and impriſoned, were by their Companions reſcued out of Priſon; for which, one of the Ringleaders was hang'd and quartered.</p>
                  <p>Now whilſt theſe things were acting at home, the turbulent <hi>Scots</hi> had entred <hi>England,</hi> and defeated a part of the Kings Army, before the whole could be imbodied, and had gained <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Durham.</hi> And no ſooner was his Majeſty come to his Army in the North, but there followed him from ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords a Petition conformable to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Remonſtrance, which they called the intentions of the Army, <hi>(viz.)</hi> not to lay down Arms till the reformed Religion (meaning <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery) was ſetled in both Nations; and the cauſers and abetters of their preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were brought to publick Juſtice, and that in Parliament. The King therefore ſummons the Lords to appear at <hi>York,</hi> September the 24, 1640. who accordingly met, where it was determined that a Parliament ſhould be called to meet <hi>November</hi> the third following; then a Treaty was agreed upon betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> for the ceaſing of all Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and one of the Articles was, That the contribution of 850 <abbr>

                  <p>The fatal long Parliament began <hi>November</hi> the third; which day, as 'tis ſaid, was looked upon by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as an unlucky day for meeting of Parliaments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Church-affairs, having proved ſo in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: whereupon he adviſed the King to put off their ſetting to another day; which his Majeſty inclined not unto, but at their meeting acquainted them, that he was reſolved to put himſelf wholly upon his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects; that he would ſatisfie all their juſt grievances; then commended to their care, the chaſing out of the ſawcy <hi>Scots,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proviſions for his own Army, and relieving the oppreſſed Northern Counties. But the Parliament, inſtead of complying with their Soveraign in his juſt propoſals, they firſt ſet upon purging their houſe of ſuch whom they thought wou'd not comply with their deſigns, finding fault either with their elections, or elſe making them criminals in ſome publick grievance; then ſetled Committees for grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and receiving Petitions; voted down Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, impeached the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> of High-Treaſon, and committed him to the black Rod; committed Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> likewiſe to the black Rod, and ten weeks after voted him guilty of High-Treaſon, and ſent him to the Tower. In the mean while <hi>Prynn, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> were freed from their confinement, and conducted into <hi>London</hi> in great State and Triumph.</p>

                     <pb n="460" facs="tcp:109115:250"/>Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> with ſome hundreds attending him, preſented the Commons with a Petition from the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> againſt the preſent Church-government. Divers Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from other places came before them of the like nature. And now the Parliament well perceiving their own ſtrength and intereſt, drew up a bill for Triennial-Parliaments; wherein the power of calling that great Council of the Nation, was upon refuſal of the King and neglect of others, devolved upon Conſtables. This the King through their importunities granted unto them. <hi>February</hi> the 16 the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament voted, That no Biſhop ſhould have any vote in Parliament, nor any Judicial power in the Star-Chamber-Court, nor have any ſway in Temporal affairs; and that no Clergy-man ſhould be in Commiſſion of Peace. And after about five months from their ſitting, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> was brought to his Tryal, in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, before the Lords as his Judges. The King, Queen, and Prince, ſetting behind a curtain in an adjoyning Gallery; and round about the Court ſtood the Commons his accuſers, and the Witneſſes againſt him were <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Anti-Epiſcoparians and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, his charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 28 Articles; to all which the Earl anſwered with ſuch firm reaſons, that he could not be found guilty of Treaſon, either in particulars, or in the whole. The Parliament therefore reſolved (for right or wrong this wiſe man muſt fall) to proceed againſt him by Bill of Attainder, and upon <hi>April</hi> the 19 by making
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:109115:250"/>
a Law after the fact, vote him guilty of High-Treaſon, yet withal add a caution for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of themſelves, that it ſhould not be drawn into a preſident. Which vote of theirs paſſed not without a long debate and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and 59 of the Members honeſtly diſſented from the vote, whoſe names were afterwards poſted and marked for the fury of the Rabble. In the bill of Attainder, the Earl was charged for endeavouring to ſubvert the ancient Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws and Government of the Realms, and for exerciſing a tyranous and exorbitant power over the liberties and eſtates of his Majeſties Subjects; and for having by his own authority commanded the laying and aſſeſſing of Soldiers upon his Majeſties Subjects in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And alſo for that upon the diſſolution of the laſt Parliament, he did ſlander the Houſe of Commons to his Majeſty, and did adviſe his Majeſty that he was looſed and abſolved from rules of Government, and that he had an Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> which he might imploy to reduce the Kingdom. And that the ſaid Earl had been an Incendiary of the Wars betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Natives or wild <hi>Iriſh</hi> began a moſt bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion throughout the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on a ſuddein invading the unprovided <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were ſcattered amongſt them, deſpoiling them of their goods, and maſſacring 200000 of them, without any reſpect of ſex, age, kindred, or friendſhip, making them as ſo many ſacrifices to their bloody ſuperſtition, the Popiſh Religion. The chief heads of this Rebellion and Maſſacre, (beſides the Prieſts) were Sir <hi>Phelim O-Neal, Turbough O-Neal</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rowry Mac-Guire, Philip O-Rely, Moelmurry, O-Rely,</hi> Sir <hi>Conno Mac-Gennis, Mac-Brian</hi> and <hi>Mac-Mahon.</hi> His Majeſty then in <hi>Scotland</hi> having intelligence of the diſmal fate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſent poſt to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to have them ſend reliefs thither; but differences ſtill heightning betwixt the King and his Parliament, ſuccours were not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſent, by which the Rebels much ſtrengthened themſelves, At the Kings return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Parliament preſented him with a Petition for taking away the votes of Biſhops in the Houſe of Lords, and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church, and for the removing of evil Councellors from about him. Their grand Remonſtrance they alſo preſented him, wherein were reckoned up the offences of the Courtiers, the unpleaſing reſolves of ſome Judges, the neglects or rigours of ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, the undigeſted Sermons of ſome Preachers, the Poſitions of ſome Divines in the Schools; unpleaſing accidents they therein repreſented as deſigns of Tyranny; and thoſe
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:109115:252"/>
things which had been reformed, were yet mentioned as burthens. To this Remonſtrance his Majeſty anſwered, That he thought he had given ſatisfaction to his Peoples fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies concerning Religion, Liberty and Civil Intereſts, by the Bills he had paſt this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; deſiring that miſunderſtandings might be removed on either ſide, and that the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> might perſwade them to unity, for the relief of that unhappy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But this modeſt anſwer of his Majeſties did not at all ſatisfie the factious. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices and Rabble in great numbers and much confuſion reſorted again to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> ſome crying out againſt Biſhops and Liturgy of the Church; others boldly menacing, that the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be taken out of the Kings hands. Affronting the Biſhops at their paſſing in and out of the Lords Houſe; and before <hi>Whitehall</hi> behaving themſelves very inſolently. His Majeſty hereupon took a Guard of ſuch Gentlemen as offered their ſervice for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but the factious made uſe of this to raiſe the rage and jealouſie of the whole City againſt the King; for at midnight there were outcries made in the ſtreets, that all people ſhould riſe to their defence, for the King and his Papiſts were coming to fire the City, and to cut their throats in their beds. The King therefore not always to incourage theſe indignities with his patience, reſolved by a courſe of Juſtice to puniſh the Authors and Countenancers of theſe ſeditious practices, ſo commanded his Attorney General to accuſe five Members of the Lower
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:109115:253"/>
Houſe of High-Treaſon, and one of the Houſe of Peers. He alſo ſent ſome Officers to Seal up their Trunks and Cabinets in their ſeveral Lodgings, and to ſecure their perſons. To this the Commons voted, That all thoſe perſons were enemies to the Commonwealth that ſhould obey the King in any of his commands concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and that it was lawful for any perſon to aſſiſt the ſaid members. And becauſe the King came into the Houſe of Commons, and there demanded to have the five Members de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to him (though he left his guard of Penſioners, and Lords and Gentlemen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out upon the ſtairs) the Commons voted this proceeding of the Kings, a breach of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of Parliament; and withal publiſhed a Declaration, That whoſoever ſhould arreſt any Member of Parliament by warrant from the King only, was guilty of the breach of Parliamentary priviledges; and likewiſe that all they who attended the King, when he came to demand the five Members (then hid in the City) were guilty of a Trayterous deſign againſt King and Parliament. The <hi>Londoners</hi> they came thronging to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in a tumultuous ſort, to Petition for the impeached Members, behaving themſelves very rudely towards the Biſhops. And ſuch increaſe and numbers of the heady common people aſſembled in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous manner about <hi>White-Hall</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> that the King juſtly miſtruſting ſome danger from them, withdrew himſelf, with the Queen and their Children, to <hi>Windſor.</hi> The next day after which, the five Members were
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:109115:253"/>
Triumphantly guarded from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> by water. Strange reports were theſe times given out concerning dangers from the King; how that Troops of <hi>Papiſts</hi> were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered about <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> under the command of Colonel <hi>Lunsford,</hi> who was Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractered to be of ſo monſtrous an Appetite, that he would eat Children, and other like falſe and ridiculous ſtories. Petitions were preſented the Parliament, requiring that neither the Biſhops nor <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lords ſhould continue to vote amongſt the Peers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Women alſo preſented a Petition to the like purpoſe. The Houſe of Commons Petitioned his Majeſty that they might have the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>London-Militia</hi> put into their hands; which he denyed to grant: yet did they place Major General <hi>Skippon</hi> over that <hi>Militia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King in hopes to ſtay the fury of the faction, conſented to almoſt all that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Howbeit, notwithſtanding all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious condeſcentions, endeavours were ſtill uſed to create an hatred of his Majeſty. Mr. <hi>John Pym</hi> publickly charged Him with a conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence at leaſt, if not with contrivance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; and when the King required ſatisfaction for the calumny, the Commons juſtified <hi>Pyms</hi> ſpeech to be the ſenſe of their Houſe. And now the breach, through bad mens practices, growing ſtill wider and wider, betwixt his Majeſty and his two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, His Majeſty reſolved to withdraw into the North, there to abide till he ſaw what iſſue this ſtorm would have; taking with him

the Prince, and Duke of <hi>York.</hi> The Queen he had afore ſent with the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> into <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the King was departed, the Parliament made preparations both by Land and Sea, upon pretext of great dangers at home, and more prodigious terrors from abroad; pretending, that by intelligence from <hi>Paris, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> they were aſſured of great deſigns to overthrow the Parliament, together with the Proteſtant Religion, and ſtrange unheard-of Plots, they ſaid, were made to murder the moſt eminent Patriots.</p>

                     <hi>A.

A little before which, were ſtrange ſights ſeen in the Air in many parts of <hi>England,</hi> as Musquetiers, harneſſed-men, and horſe-men, moving in Battel-array, and aſſaulting one the other in divers furious poſtures. The King and the two Houſes now began to make all the ſpeedieſt warlike preparations to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and offend each other, but the two Houſes had a great advantage of his Majeſty, both in reſpect of moneys, and the ſpeedy
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:109115:254"/>
raiſing of Men, and alſo Arms and Ammunition for war of all ſorts, through their having the City of <hi>London</hi> on their ſide, the Citizens whereof were very free in parting with their Plate upon the publick faith; and their Wives were ſo zealous for the good Cauſe (as that of the two Houſes was then miſcalled) that they gave their very Bodkins and Thimbles towards the maintaining of it, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to have Husbands and Children to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their lives in this Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Auguſt</hi> 22. 1642, did his Majeſty ſet up his Standard-Royal at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> His General was the Valiant Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments General was <hi>Robert Devereux</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and their Admiral the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi> The firſt blood that was ſpilt in this unhappy war, was near unto <hi>Hull,</hi> whither ſome forces of the Kings forces were drawn, upon whom Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> and Sir <hi>John Meldram</hi> ſallied, taking ſome, and killing others.</p>

The King had ſo much the better of the day as to keep the Field. Perſons of remark ſlain on his Majeſties ſide, were the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Varney</hi> Standard-bearer; but Mr.

On the Parliaments part were ſlain the Lord St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Bletſo,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Eſſex.</hi> From this fight at <hi>Edg-hill</hi> the King marched to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which was ſurrendred to him; then entred <hi>Oxford</hi> triumphantly, and having ſecured that place, he advanced toward <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Brant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> fell upon two Regiments of his Enemies, taking about 500 Priſoners. The Parliament to encreaſe their Numbers, declared that all Apprentices that would liſt themſelves in their ſervice for the Publick Cauſe, ſhould be ſecured from the injury of their Maſters, and their time to go on toward their freedom; by which means multitudes of Youth forſook their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to fight for the Parliament. They alſo invited their Brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> (as they call'd them) to come into <hi>England</hi> to their aid. And to animate the people to take up Arms for the Parliament, ſome buſie Clergy-men made great (not good) uſe of that ſacred Text in their Pulpits, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Judges</hi> the 5.23. But, <hi>bleſſed are the Peace makers,</hi> ſaith the Prince of peace.

After the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Newark,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army marched back towards their own Country as far as <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> where when they were come, they tendred their Covenant to the King, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that unleſs he would take that, they durſt not bring him into <hi>Scotland.</hi> This the King refuſed not, if they would firſt ſatisfy thoſe ſcruples concerning Church-Government which lay upon his Conſcience, which to effect, Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderſon</hi> a Miniſter, the Oracle of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> was imployed to converſe with him. His Majeſties parts were ſo great, and Cauſe ſo good, that made all Mr. <hi>Henderſons</hi> attempts ſucceſleſs. See the Printed papers of their Diſputations.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe things were acting at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the bargain was ſtruck at <hi>London</hi> betwixt the Parliament and <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſiones; and for 200000<abbr>l.</abbr> the <hi>Scots</hi> delivered the King up to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament. Yet to mask their perfidy, the <hi>Scots</hi> added this caution, That there ſhould be no attempt made upon the Kings perſon, but being entertained at one of his own Palaces, he ſhould be there treated with upon propoſitions from both Nations, which ſhould be ſpeedily ſent unto him.</p>

                     <hi>February</hi> the 6th, the <hi>Scots</hi> left <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and marched homeward, and two days after the King ſet forward with the Parliaments Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>Holmby,</hi> attended with 900 Horſe. And now the Parliament, becauſe they wanted others to quarrel withall, fell to quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, dividing into two parties, <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> with <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and the other Sectariſts. The <hi>Preſbiterians</hi> were then powerful in the Houſe, but the other in the Army, and were a ſubtle and reſolute peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The former of theſe parties ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in danger of being ſupplanted by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, voted in Parliament, to have part of the Army disbanded, another part of it ſent over into <hi>Ireland</hi> towards the reducing that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the remainder to be diſpoſed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of <hi>England</hi> to keep the Royalliſts in awe. This put the Army into a heat, who to make their part ſure, ſent a party of Horſe, commanded by Cornet <hi>Joyce,</hi> to ſeize upon the Kings perſon, and to bring him from <hi>Holmby</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own quarters, which was done, <hi>June</hi> the 3d, 1647: From <hi>Holmby</hi> they conveyed His Majeſty to <hi>Childerſley,</hi> and thence to <hi>New-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> the Grandees of the Army pretending to him, how they were grieved for his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſufferings, profeſſing they would never part with their Arms, till they had made his way to his Throne, (but it muſt be a Throne in Heaven). And the more to palliate their evil meanings, they permitted him the ſervice of his own Chaplains, (which he had been denied at <hi>Holmby</hi>) the commerce of Letters with the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:109115:260"/>
Queen, the viſits of his own party, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Courtiers. The Parliament vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the General ſhould be required to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the King to their Commiſſioners, who were to bring him to <hi>Richmond,</hi> to the end that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of peace might be ſpeedily preſented him. Hereupon the Army drew up Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Eleven of the Members of the Commons Houſe, namely, Mr. <hi>Denzill Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Lewis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> Collonel <hi>Maſſey,</hi> Collonel <hi>Long,</hi> Collonel <hi>Harley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Glyn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anthony Nichols.</hi> Nor would the Army be ſatisfied till the Houſe was purged of theſe Members. Which being done, the Army-party became ſomething prevalent, who voted that the <hi>London</hi>-Militia ſhould be taken out of the hands of the City, and transferred to others better affected to the Army: and that it ſhould be Treaſon to ſeek for Subſcriptions to Petitions. Hereupon great multitudes of Apprentices and others in a tumultuous ſort reſorted to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Houſe, and there kept the Speaker in his Chair till this vote was paſt; That the King ſhould come to <hi>London</hi> to treat, and that the City ſhould have the ordering of their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia. <hi>Fairfax</hi> underſtanding this, haſts with his Army to <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Hounſlow</hi> was met by the Speaker, and ſuch of the Members as ſided with the Army, who complained of the violence that was offered them. In the mean while the Citizens and Presbyterian part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made ſome preparations to oppoſe the Army; but upon the Generals approach to the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:109115:260"/>
City, the Gates were thrown open, and the Army marched in Triumph through the City, ſeized upon the Tower, diſmantled the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, impriſoned the Mayor, and divers of the chief Citizens, and committed ſome Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the black Rod.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>September,</hi> the Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſent propoſitions to His Majeſty then at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> which were the ſame in ſubſtance with thoſe formerly offered, as for the aboliſhing Epiſcopacy, the Parliament to have the diſpoſal of all great Offices of Truſt.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Parliament voted, That 6000 Foot and 2400 Horſe and Dragoons ſhould be ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and 18000 Foot and 7200 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons ſhould be kept up as a ſtanding Army for <hi>England,</hi> the reſt of the Soldiers to be disbanded.

of <hi>Wight,</hi> where his Majeſty condeſcended ſo far unto the Parliaments demands, (which were the ſame in ſubſtance with thoſe formerly made) that both Houſes came to this reſolve, That the Kings Conceſſions were a ſufficient ground for peace. But this did exceedingly inrage the factious Members and Commanders of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who now reſolved to ſeize the King into their own hands and diſpoſe, which they did, removing him out of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and making him Priſoner in <hi>Hurſt</hi>-Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> the 30th. the Army then fell to purging the Parliament, apprehending forty Members thereof, that were perſons of the moſt known integrity, and higheſt reſolution, denying admiſſion to 150 more; and ſuffering none to enter the Houſe, ſave ſuch whom they knew would ſerve their deſigns. Which Army-Members revived thoſe Votes of no more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the King; the Votes for a Treaty with the King, and of the ſatisfactorineſs of his Conceſſions, they razed out of the Journal-book. And then proceeded to vote, That the ſupreme authority of the Nation reſided in themſelves; That to raiſe Arms againſt the Peoples Repreſentatives, or the Parliament, was High-treaſon; That the King himſelf took Arms againſt the Parliament, and ſo was guilty of the blood-ſhed throughout the Civil-war. And therefore this fag-end of a Parliament was reſolved to have his Majeſty brought to his Trial, in order thereto giving their commands for his bringing up to <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>January</hi> the 19th, he was accordingly brought to St. <hi>James</hi>'s.

When the factious Members whom the Army had licenſed to ſit, proceeded to conſtitute a Court for the Trial of the King, giving it the ſpecious name of the High Court of Juſtice; which ſaid Court they impowred to convene, hear, judg, and execute <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe proceedings the Houſe of Lords deteſted, ſo did the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Judges of the Land affirmed it to be contrary to the known Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> for the King to be brought to Trial; and the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Miniſters did both publickly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately diſſwade them from this horrid action, though all in vain.

                  <p>Tueſday <hi>January</hi> the 30th. in the morning, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> read Divine Service in his Majeſties preſence, when the 27th. Chapter of St. <hi>Mathew</hi>'s Goſpel, the Hiſtory of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Crucifixion fell out to be the ſecond Leſſon. After Morning-prayer, the King received the Sacrament, and performed private Devotions in preparation to his Paſſion; which being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, about Ten of the Clock this moſt Chriſtian King was brought from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>Whitehall</hi> by a Regiment of Foot, and a private Guard of Partizans, the Biſhop on one hand of him, and Colonel <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> (who had the charge of him) on the other, both bare headed. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty walked very faſt, and bad them go faſter: thus ſaying, <hi>That he now went before them to ſtrive
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:109115:266"/>
for an Heavenly Crown with leſs ſolicitude, than he had often encouraged his Soldiers to fight for an Earthly Diadem.</hi> Being come into the Cabinet-Chamber in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where he uſed to lodg, he there paſs'd the time for near two hours in his Devotion, about Twelve he eat a bit of bread, and drank a glaſs of Clarret; and towards One, Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> with other Officers and Soldiers brought him through the Banquetting-houſe, and through a Window of that upon a Scaffold which was hung with Black. Divers Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Foot, and Troops of Horſe were placed on each ſide of the Street, which hindred the approach of the very numerous ſpectators; therefore the King directed his Speech chiefly to Col. <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> therein declaring his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, how that he began not the War with his two Houſes of Parliament, calling God to witneſs that he never intended to incroach upon their priviledges, but they began upon him; and that he believed that ill inſtruments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and them had been the cauſe of all the bloodſhed. Then acknowledged Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be juſt upon himſelf in ſuffering an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſentence to paſs upon him, for that he had ſuffered an unjuſt ſentence to be executed upon another (meaning upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>) Then declared himſelf to be a good Chriſtian, having forgiven all the World, and even thoſe in particular, who ever they were, that had been the chief cauſers of his death; deſiring God to forgive them, and that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of that great ſin; praying with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> that this might not be laid to their charge; and
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:109115:266"/>
wiſhed they might take the right way for the peace of the Kingdom, which was, he ſaid, by giving God his due in regulating rightly his Church according to the Scriptures. By giving the King his due, being directed by the Laws of the Land. By giving the people their due, in having Government under thoſe Laws, by which their lives and goods might be moſt their own, and not be ſubject to an Arbitrary power; for the oppoſing of which, ſaid he, it is, that I am brought to the Scaffold: for if ſaid he, I would have given way to an Arbitrary power, or way to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I need not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and pray God it be not laid to your charge) that I am the Martyr of the People. Then he declared he died a Chriſtian according to the Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as he found it left him by his Father. After this he diſcourſed with the Biſhop, to whom he gave his <hi>George</hi> to be ſent to the Prince; then preparing himſelf for the Block, he ſaid, <hi>I have a good cauſe, and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God on my ſide, I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where is no diſturbance, no diſturbance in the world.</hi> Then having ſaid a few words to himſelf, as he ſtood with hands and eyes lift up, he laid his neck upon the Block, and after a ſhort pauſe, ſtretching forth his hands, the Vizarded Executioner at one blow ſevered his Royal Head from his Body. Whoſe blood was taken up by ſeveral perſons for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ends, by ſome as Trophies of their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, by others as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>JAnuary</hi> the 30th, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was then in <hi>Holland</hi> when his Father King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was murdered; and that tayl of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were reſolved inſtead of admitting him the lawful Heir unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England,</hi> to aſſume it unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To which end, they firſt ſet forth a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, That no perſon whatſoever ſhould preſume to proclaim or any way to promote <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> Son of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> late King of <hi>England,</hi> or any other perſon, to be King or chief Magiſtrate of theſe Kingdoms, but he that ſhould attempt any ſuch thing ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Traytor. After this they voted the Houſe of Lords to be uſeleſs and dangerous, and Kingly Government to be unneceſſary and burthenſome, and therefore they aboliſhed both. Howbeit the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> cauſed his Majeſty to be publickly proclaimed King in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Parliament did the like in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> having a Victorious Army on their ſide, proceeded to eſtabliſh their Projects, cauſed all publick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to be iſſued out in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> by Authority of Parliament; ordering a new great Seal to be made with the Croſs and Harp on one ſide, and this Inſcription, <hi>The great Seal of England;</hi> on the other ſide the picture of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with this Inſcription, <hi>In the firſt year of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:109115:270"/>
freedom by Gods bleſſing reſtored</hi> 1648. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they appointed that all moneys to be coyned, ſhould be ſtamped with the Croſs and Harp on one ſide, and the Croſs on the other, with this Motto, <hi>The Commonwealth of England, God with us.</hi> And inſtead of the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Allegiance, they impoſed an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the people, To be true and faithful to the Commonwealth, as it was then eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without King or Houſe of Lords. A Council of State they conſtituted by the name of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> conſiſting of forty perſons, who were to have the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the Government. Thus was <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> ancient Government ſoon changed by about 50 perſons who ſtiled themſelves a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Repreſentative body of <hi>England.</hi> The maxim upon which they grounded theſe their alterations, and all other their illegal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, was this, That all power and authority is originally in the people; and that they were the peoples Repreſentative. When this <hi>Junto</hi> had made ſuch a module of Government, they erected another High Court of Injuſtice for the trial of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> as Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> of the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> all which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die for engaging in their Soveraign's cauſe; but the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen</hi> were reprieved, the other three were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the Palace-yard at <hi>Weſtminſter, March</hi> the 9th The ever loyal Lord <hi>Capel</hi> in his ſpeech on the Scaffold declared, that he died againſt the Juſtice of the known Laws of the Land, and
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:109115:271"/>
for no other cauſe than his aſſerting the Fifth Commandment; prayed heartily for the King, for his reſtoration, long life and proſperity; ſhutting up his Speech with a profeſſion of his cheerfulneſs in forgiving his Enemies. Other good Subjects they put to death in other places of the Nation, Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Morris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beaumont</hi> a Miniſter, Major <hi>Monday</hi> and Cornet <hi>Blackburn.</hi> And many were the loyal perſons that were now proſcribed, and had their Eſtates confiſcated, as the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Lords <hi>Cottington, Widdrington, Culpepper, Byron,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Muſgrave,</hi> Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Greenvill,</hi> with others. And all that had been in actual Arms for the King, or other ſervice, were forced to compound for their Eſtates if they had any, to the great impoveriſhing of the Royal party.</p>

                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1649, and <hi>April</hi> the 7th, The Members at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for the better ſupply of their Army, and taking away of free-quarter, paſſed an Act for the levying of 90000 <abbr>

                  <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Kings Lieutenant the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> in order to promote the Kings cauſe there, concluded a peace with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>June</hi> the 22d he beſieged the City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> but <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 2d Colonel <hi>Michael Jones</hi> with his whole ſtrength, being betwixt 8 and 9000, ſallied out upon the beſiegers who were 19000 Horſe and Foot, and routed them totally, ſlew of them about 3000, took Priſoners 2517, took all the Marqueſs's train of Artillery and Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and a very rich booty in the Camp. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 16th, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> landed with his forces at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and after a ſhort ſtay there, marched with great expedition againſt <hi>Tredagh,</hi> or <hi>Drogedah,</hi> where Sir <hi>Arthur Aſhton</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; the defendants of that Town did brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behave themſelves, howbeit <hi>Oliver</hi> gained it by ſtorm, giving ſtrict order to his Soldiers, that they ſhould afford quarter neither to Man, Woman, or Child, but ſhould kill all. He vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:109115:272"/>
to one of his Commanders, <hi>That he would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their bodies to the ſouls of the Engliſh men they had formerly murdered.</hi> Next <hi>Oliver</hi> beſieged <hi>Wexford,</hi> which through the treachery of one <hi>Strafford,</hi> was yielded: And ſhortly after this, many engariſoned places were reduced, by <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> forces. The Plantation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> that had refuſed ſubjection to the new Republick of <hi>England,</hi> was forced to a conformity by Sir <hi>George Ayſcoughs</hi> Fleet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 23, Mr. <hi>John Lilbourn,</hi> the Leader of the Levelling party, one that had wit enough, but of a thwarting, turbulent ſpirit, was tryed at <hi>Guildhall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for writing againſt the Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and their Council of State; but he ſo well pleaded his caſe, and had ſo lucky a Jury, that he was quit in deſpight of his Judges.</p>
                  <p>About this time Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the King's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, was diſtreſt and put to his ſhifts by the <hi>Junto's</hi> Fleet, loſing moſt of his Ships, with his Brother Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> who was then caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1650. In the beginning of this year, the truly Loyal and Magnanimous Marqueſs of <hi>Momroſs</hi> was defeated in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Straughorn;</hi> the Marqueſs himſelf by quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Horſe, and ſhifting himſelf into an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, Highlanders habit, made a ſhift to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape for the preſent; his ſtandard was taken, in which was pourtrayed the Head of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt lying a bleeding, and ſevered from the body, with this Motto, <hi>Judg and revenge my cauſe, O Lord.</hi> The Marqueſs after ſome days
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:109115:272"/>
wandring about in by-places, came to the Laird of <hi>Aſtons</hi> Houſe, a perſon whom the Marqueſs had done ſeveral kindneſſes for; but this falſe <hi>Scot,</hi> whether for fear or lucre, betrayed this diſtreſſed Peer into the hands of his Enemy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Leſley,</hi> who ſent him to the City of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> where the common Hangman met him at the Towns end, and firſt pulled off his Hat, then forced him into a Cart which had a high Chair placed in it, in which the Marqueſs was ſeated, that thereby he might be the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ſcorns of the vulgar. But his noble ſoul was not at all diſmayed, for God he ſaid, did all the while moſt comfortably mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his preſence to him, and furniſhed him with courage to overlook the reproaches of men, and to behold him for whoſe cauſe he ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>After the ſentence of Parliament was paſſed for the bereaving him of his life, he expreſſed to them how much he was beholden to them for the honour they had conferred on him; <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I account it greater honour to have my head ſtand on the Priſon-gate for my loyalty to my King, than to have my Picture placed in his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; and I wiſh I had fleſh enough, not only to be ſet up in four Cities, but to have a piece of it ſent to every City in Chriſtendom, for a teſtimony of my loyalty to my King and Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> the 31ſt, he was brought to the place of his Execution, where being mounted on a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he told the people, That God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffer a juſt man to periſh in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and a wicked man to proſper in his wickedneſs; prayed God to forgive his enemies,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:109115:273"/>
for he did; declared that what he had done in that kingdom, was in obedience to the moſt juſt commands of his Sovereign. That he eſteemed the late King lived a Saint, and dyed a Martyr, praying God he might ſo end as he had done. That he believed never people could be more happy, than they might in His preſent Majeſty. Gave God thanks that he went to Heavens Throne with joy, though death looked upon him in its moſt ugly ſhape. Then deſired their charity and prayers, concluding thus: I leave my ſoul to God, my ſervice to my Prince, my good will to my Friends, and my name and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to you all. Then having prayed a while, he received from the Executioner a cord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at hung a Declaration of his fact, to hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, which accordingly he hung there, ſaying, that he thought himſelf not more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Garter, than by that Cord and Paper: adding, That if they had any more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to put upon him, he was ready to accept it. And then with a chearful countenance he ſubmitted himſelf to the execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to be hang'd on a Gallows Thirty foot high, for the ſpace of three hours.

                  <p>Howbeit His Majeſty hoping that now at length <hi>England</hi> might be favourable to his juſt Cauſe, he advances into <hi>England</hi> by the way of <hi>Carlile</hi> with about 16000 men, bending his courſe by a ſwift march for the Weſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> though it was hoped by his friends he would have directed his courſe for <hi>London.</hi> But <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 23, the King with his Army entred the City of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> with all haſt marched after him, by the way joyning with <hi>Fleetwood, Desbrough,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby, Lambert, Harriſon,</hi> and the Militia-forces of ſeveral Counties; ſo that his Army when he was come to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> could not amount to fewer then 80000 men. In <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> had raiſed for the King near 1500 Horſe and Foot, againſt whom Colonel <hi>Lilbourn</hi> marched, and routed them, taking many perſons of quality; the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> himſelf with much ado eſcaped to the King at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where on that twice fatal, but once Lucky day, <hi>September</hi> the 3d, his Majeſty being

But at length his Army being overpowered by the numerous freſh ſupplies of his enemies, His Majeſties ſide was put to the worſt, his Horſe flying amain towards the North, and his Foot into <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whither they were followed at the heels by their Victors, who entred the City with them, which they plundred, killing and taking moſt of the <hi>Scots</hi> Priſoners; thoſe Horſe that fled were purſued, and great part of them taken, and the poor ſtragling <hi>Scots</hi> were either made Priſoners, or killed by the Country People. The number of the Kings party ſlain, were judged to be about 3000, and of Priſoners taken in the whole near 10000; amongſt whom were Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Derby, Cleveland, Lauderdaile, Rotho, Carnwath,</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> the Lord <hi>Synclare,</hi> Sir <hi>John Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Cunningham,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Clare,</hi> Major General <hi>Piſcotty,</hi> Major General <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi> Colonel <hi>Graves,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fanſhaw</hi> the Kings Secretary, the Adjutant General.

                  <p>A little before this fight at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> divers perſons, many of them <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters, were ſeized on for holding correſpondence with <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> (none might, as they loved their lives and eſtates, call him King) and on <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 22, were two of them, namely Mr. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> Love Miniſter, and Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>

                  <p>The common Priſoners, <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> taken at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> were ſent up to <hi>London;</hi> and that they might no further trouble the States of <hi>England,</hi> they were tranſported into Foreign Plantations.</p>

                     <hi>October</hi> the 15th, the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> was beheaded, and Sir <hi>Timothy Fetherſtonhaugh</hi> dyed the ſame death alſo, for the ſame crime, <hi>viz.</hi> for honouring the King.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands,</hi> for the affronts done to their Ambaſſadors <hi>Oliver</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Walter Strickland,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and their incroaching on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants trade, and ſlighting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> States, who proffered ſtrict amity and alliance.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon they prohibited the importing any Foreign Comodities except upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or ſuch as were of the Country whence the goods came, beginning withal to ſtand high upon the claim of dues, and reparations for the prejudice done the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and when no ſatisfaction would be given, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> grew rather more Lordly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into queſtion the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soveraignty in the narrow Seas, and refuſing to give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the honour of the FLAG, the States of <hi>England</hi> reſolved to beat them into better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And in the Year of our Lord, 1652, on <hi>May</hi> the 19th, was the firſt Sea-fight between the States of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the fight continued about four hours, till the night parted them; without much cauſe of boaſting on either part; that which was, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had a right to. But ſhortly after this, Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> took twelve <hi>Dutch</hi> men of War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 16th, Sir <hi>George Ayſcough</hi> with a ſquadron of ſeven Ships, charged through and

through the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of ſixty men of War, in which Encounter Captain <hi>Pack</hi> was ſlain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> the fifth, as the <hi>French</hi> Fleet (who took part with the <hi>Dutch</hi>) were going to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> moſt of them were taken by General <hi>Blake;</hi> and about the concluſion of the ſame month, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were bang'd to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by <hi>Blake,</hi> at a place called the <hi>Kentiſh-Knock,</hi> and were purſued by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into their very Harbor. But in the beginning of Winter, <hi>Blake</hi> was worſted by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Downs,</hi> loſing the <hi>Garland, Bonadventure,</hi> and two Merchantmen. Upon the 18, 19, and 20th. days of <hi>February,</hi> the two Fleets fought again, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> were forced to fly, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> taking fifty-two of their Merchant-men they had in Convoy, and nine men of War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.

Inſtead of theſe Members turned out of doors, <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a Council of State to rule the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, though they reſolved to rule the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> the 2d the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged again in Fight, when at the very firſt ſhot made by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> General <hi>Richard Dean</hi> was
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:109115:277"/>
ſlain. <hi>June</hi> the 3d the Fleets joined again, and the diſpute was very hot and bloody, till at length the <hi>Dutch</hi> tacked about, and made haſte to their own Coaſts. Of the <hi>Dutch</hi> were taken Priſoners ſix Captains, 1350 others, Eleven men of War were taken, and two Hoys, ſix of their beſt Ships were ſunk, and two blown up. Of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſlain beſides Admiral <hi>Dean,</hi> one Captain, and a hundred and twenty others, but not one Ship loſt or diſabled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cromwell</hi> this while, with ſome of the leading Officers of the Army, had made choice of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons, not above 150 for the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who were to have the Legiſlative power, and to be ſtiled a Parliament. Theſe Parliament-Gentlemen and Soldiers of the new-faſhioned Election, met <hi>July</hi> the 4th. at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they choſe Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> for their Speaker; but not agreeing amongſt themſelves (for about ſixty of them conteſted hard for the taking away of Tythes from the Miniſters as Antichriſtian) they fairly re-delivered their power into <hi>Oliver</hi>'s hands, <hi>December</hi> the twelfth, after they had En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a Law, That Juſtices of the Peace and not Miniſters ſhould join perſons together in ſacred Wedlock.</p>
                  <p>But while this cunning thing called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was doing little, or little to the purpoſe, the active <hi>Dutch</hi> were again put forth to Sea with about 120 Men of War, and before the <hi>Texel</hi> were Encountred by the <hi>Engliſh, July</hi> 29th, the Fight was vigorouſly maintained on both parts, till the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral <hi>Van Trump,</hi> fighting in the midſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, was with a
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:109115:278"/>
Musket-ſhot ſhot into the left-Pap, and ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, whereby the reſt of their Fleet was ſo diſcouraged, that they made to the <hi>Texel</hi> as ſpeedily as they could. The <hi>Dutch</hi> in this Fight loſt 30 Men of War, and about 1200 of their Men were taken. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſlain on their part, <hi>Graves, Owen, Chapman, Newman, Taylor, Criſp, Cox</hi> and <hi>Peacock,</hi> Captains, and 400 common Seamen. The Ship named the <hi>Oak</hi> was fired, and two or three diſabled. For this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piece of ſervice, the little Parliament or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Chains of Gold ſhould be preſented to the Admirals <hi>Blake,</hi> and Col. <hi>George Monk,</hi> Vice-Admiral <hi>Pen,</hi> and Rear-Admiral <hi>Lawſon;</hi> and that other Chains likewiſe ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to divers Flag-Captains, and Medals of Silver to the Officers of the Fleet.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Oliver,</hi> who after his patcht <hi>Junto</hi> had diſſolved themſelves, called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Officers, with ſome others of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to conſult about the ſettlement of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and theſe at length, after great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſeeking Gods mind herein, concluded to have a ſingle perſon again to be the head of the Commonwealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging. And was accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled with much formality and ceremony, in the <hi>Chancery</hi>-Court at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> before the Judges, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with the chief Officers of the Army, on <hi>December</hi> the 16th. Immediately after which, all publick Writings changed their ſtile from that of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> to
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:109115:278"/>
that of <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>A.</hi> D. 1654. and in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> upon an accuſation of a Plot to deſtroy the Protector, ſeize the Tower, raiſe an Army, and bring in the King, there were divers Royaliſts apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and committed to priſon, three of whom were condemned by an High Court of Injuſtice, and two of them Executed, namely Col. <hi>John Gerrard</hi> who was Beheaded on <hi>Towerhill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> who was hang'd at <hi>Charing-croſs;</hi> on the ſame day with Col. <hi>Gerrard</hi> was Beheaded Don <hi>Pantaleon Sa,</hi> Brother to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, for a Riot made in the <hi>New Exchange;</hi> but death was ſo terrible to this perſon, that his heart was nigh quite dead within him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his neck came to the Block.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> the third, a pretended Parliament met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where after they had heard their Maſter <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Speech, and choſe <hi>William Lenthall</hi> for their Speaker, they debated, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Legiſlative power ſhould be in a ſingle perſon and a Parliament, or in a Parliament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Protector's faction were for the former; thoſe called the Commonwealth-party, that
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:109115:279"/>
were for a Democratical Government, were for the latter; one declaring, That as God had made him an Inſtrument in cutting down Tyranny in one perſon, ſo now he would not endure to ſee the Nations Liberties ſhackled by another, whoſe right to the Government could be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out no other way than by the length of his Sword. But when theſe things were reported to the Uſurper <hi>Oliver,</hi> he haſted from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there declares to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he would have them to take notice of this, That the ſame Government made him a Protector, as made them a Parliament: That as they were intruſted with ſome things, ſo was he with others: That there were certain Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals which could not be altered: as, That the Government ſhould be in a ſingle perſon and Parliament: That Parliament's ſhould not be perpetual: That in Religious matters there ſhould be liberty of Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then he enjoined them to ſign this Recognition of the Government, <hi>viz. I do hereby promiſe and engage to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and ſhall not (according to the tenour of the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby I am returned to ſerve in Parliament) propoſe or give my conſent to alter the Government as 'tis ſetled in one perſon and a Parliament.</hi> The ſubſcription to this was refuſed by ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the reſt who ſubſcribed it were permitted to ſit till <hi>January</hi> the 24th, 1654, at which time <hi>Oliver</hi> diſſolved them, becauſe they delayed to ſettle him in the Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>December</hi> the 19th. <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Venables</hi> with a
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:109115:279"/>
Fleet of thirty Ships, wherein were three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand forces, put to Sea, and in <hi>April</hi> following arrived at <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and came within ſight of that Golden Town <hi>Sancta Domingo,</hi> upon which their firſt and chief enterprize was deſigned; but through the exceſſive heat of the Clime, want of freſh-water, and ſome other diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, great numbers of the Soldiers periſhed, and that deſign was fruitleſs; therefore they ſet ſail for the Iſland <hi>Jamaica;</hi> where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, they were there ſo ſucceſsful, as in ſhort time to poſſeſs themſelves of the chief Town called <hi>Ottranto,</hi> bringing the whole Iſland into ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Royal party were buſie to take down the Protector's Greatneſs; but the Plot was diſcovered before it was ripe for execution, and many of the Conſpirators in ſeveral places ſeized on by the <hi>Olivarians.</hi> At <hi>Salisbury, March</hi> the 11th. a party of about 200 Cavaliers were in Arms, but were diſperſed, and ſome of their chief Leaders taken, as Mr. <hi>Grove,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Penruddock,</hi> Major <hi>Dean, Jones,</hi> &amp;c. Others there were in Arms about <hi>Shrewsbury, Sherwood</hi>-Foreſt in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and another party in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> where Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> was taken: Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Penruddock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grove,</hi> were beheaded at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and ſome others of them were hang'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> D. 1655. about the beginning of this year Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> with his Fleet performed a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring piece of ſervice at <hi>Tunis,</hi> where demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Dye or Governour of <hi>Tunis</hi> repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the loſſes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuſtained from
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:109115:280"/>
                     <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirates, and having a ſcornful anſwer returned, he boldly preſs'd upon their Ships lying under the Caſtle of <hi>Goletta,</hi> and there burnt nine Ships with but the loſs of 25 men; in the mean time plying continued Broadſides upon the Caſtle within Musket-ſhot of it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Protector conſtituted a new kind of Officers called Major-Generals, who were each of them (being eleven in number) in their ſeveral limits aſſigned them to ſuperviſe the actions of the poor Royaliſts, and to deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their Eſtates, and indeed to do what they liſted; but theſe after they had tyranized a while, were laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the 16th. did the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> declare open War againſt <hi>England,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately thereupon was a Peace concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> one of the Articles of which was. That the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> (King of <hi>England</hi>) and all his Relations and Adherents out of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and accordingly the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was Complemented to depart <hi>France</hi> by ſuch a time; nor was his Retinue to ſtay after him; had his Majeſty himſelf been there, he muſt have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame dealing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the 21. died that Learned Prelate Dr. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> A. B. of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and was buried in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> D. 1656, To begin this year well for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Oliver,</hi> ſome of his Fleet under the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Mountague,</hi> not far from <hi>Cades</hi> or <hi>Cales,</hi> ſet upon a Fleet of eight <hi>Spaniards,</hi> one of which they ſunk, two burnt, one run aſhore,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:109115:280"/>
and two the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took, one whereof had a great quantity of Plate and Cochenel in her, the other laden chiefly with Hides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> the 17th. another of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where before they were admitted to enter the Houſe, they muſt ſeverally engage not to act any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the preſent Government; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of them returned home, the reſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Houſe, choſe Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> their Speaker, and ſet themſelves to act ſuitably to <hi>Oliver</hi>'s wiſhes, paſſing an Act for renouncing and diſannulling the title of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> unto the Government of the Nations of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. and making it to be treaſon againſt the Protector, as it formerly had been againſt the Kings perſon; then ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moneys to be raiſed in the three Nations for paying the Armies. And ordered a years rent to be paid the Protector for every Houſe built upon a new foundation within ten miles of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding the proviſion made to ſecure the Protector's perſon, there were divers attempts made to kill him, and a printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was publiſhed, intituled, <hi>Killing no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> One <hi>Miles Sindercomb</hi> formerly a Soldier in the Army, had determined to ſhoot, or by one means or other to rid the world of him; but his deſign being betrayed, he was condemned to be hang'd and quartered; to prevent which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his own death, 'tis ſaid, by ſnuffing up a poyſonous powder into his head; wherefore as a ſelf-murderer he was drag'd at a Horſes-tail
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:109115:281"/>
from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Towerhill,</hi> where being turned naked into a hole, a ſtake ſpiked with iron was driven through him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1657. This year commenced with a Conſpiracy of Fifth-Monarchiſts to have pull'd down <hi>Oliver;</hi> but the Plot was diſcovered, and the Projectors apprehended; the chief of whom was Major General <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Lawſon,</hi> Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> Major <hi>Danvers,</hi> and Captain <hi>Venner;</hi> their Standard which they had in readineſs, had pourtraied in it a Lion couchant Gules in a field Argent, with this Motto, <hi>Who ſhall rouze him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> the 20th, Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> performed another notable exploit, for at <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> in <hi>Teneriffa,</hi> the chief <hi>Iſland</hi> of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he fired and ſunk 16 great Ships, among which was the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rear-Admiral, and two or three Gallions; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beſides the loſs of their whole Fleet, had many hundreds of men ſlain on the ſhore; yet in this notable Action, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had but 48 men ſlain, and 120 wounded; the Protector to gratifie the Admiral for this his brave ſervice, ſent him a Diamond Ring worth 500 <abbr>l</abbr>, and Captain <hi>Richard Strainer</hi> who led the firſt ſquadron, was at his coming into <hi>England</hi> for this and his other good ſervice at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> honoured with Knighthood.</p>
                  <p>And now the Parliament, who had been long debating concerning the ſetling of his Highneſs, at laſt preſent him with a certain thing called, <hi>The humble Petition and Advice,</hi> deſiring him
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:109115:281"/>
to take the government of the three Nations upon him, with the ſtile of King; which ſtile he refuſed, as foreſeeing this would diſguſt the <hi>Sectariſts</hi> generally; therefore contented himſelf with the Power Royal, and his old ſtile of Lord Protector, which the Parliament confirmed. And <hi>June</hi> the 26th, his Highneſs was with great State and Magnificence inſtalled in his Office of Protector in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> where the Speaker in the name of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, preſented him with a Robe of Purple-Velvet, lined with Ermine, a Sword, a large Bible richly gilt and boſſed, and a Scepter of Gold. And when the Speaker, Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and Sir <hi>Bulſtrode Whitlock</hi> had veſted <hi>Oliver,</hi> then the Speaker adminiſtred the Oath to him in theſe following words: <hi>I do in the preſence and by the name of Almighty God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſwear that to the utmoſt of my power, I will uphold and maintain the true reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, in the purity thereof, as it is contained in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtaments, and encourage the profeſſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof, and that to the utmoſt of my power, I will endeavor as chief Magiſtrate of theſe three Nations, the maintenance and preſervation of the peace and ſafety, and juſt Rights and Priviledges of the People thereof, and ſhall in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my beſt knowledge and power, govern the People according to Law.</hi> This Oath being taken by him, he was immediately proclaimed Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. And that done, ſome Souldiers and others cryed, God ſave the Lord Protector.
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:109115:282"/>
                     <hi>Oliver</hi> thus eſtabliſhed in his mightineſs by Parliment, he falls to faſhion his family after the manner of a Kings Court, hath his Yeomen of the Guard in their livery of gray Cloath, welted with black Velvet; over whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Walter Strickland;</hi> His Lord Keeper was <hi>Nathaniel Fines;</hi> and Lord Chamberlain, Sir <hi>Gilbert Pickering,</hi> &amp;c. And the better to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then himſelf at home, and to raiſe his Family into eſteem, he gave his eldeſt Son a Command in the Army, his younger Son he made Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> his two younger Daughters that were not yet diſpoſed of in marriage, he matched the elder of them with Mr. <hi>Robert Rich</hi> the Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> Grandſon, and the youngeſt with a perſon of great Honour. And that he might be as King-like as poſſible, and withal check the Commons in Parliment, he conſtituted an Upper Houſe of Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Houſe of Lords, 62 in number. moſt of them his own creatures; amongſt whom were Colonel <hi>Hewſon,</hi> one by trade next kin to a Cobler; and Colonel <hi>Pride,</hi> formerly a Brewers ſervant; who before this had been made two of his knights errants. And to honour his Muſhrooms, he elected to ſet in his Upper Houſe ſome few Noble men, as the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the 20th, the Parliment that had been adjourned, now reaſſembled; but becauſe they admitted thoſe Members to ſit with them, who at firſt refuſed to ſubſcribe to <hi>Olivers</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; and becauſe they queſtioned the Protectors power in erecting his Upper Houſe,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:109115:282"/>
(which in contempt they called <hi>the other Houſe) Oliver</hi> hereupon ſent for them to his Upper Houſe Bar, where he made a large ſpeech to them, and in concluſion told them, That it did concern as well the peace and tranquility of the Nation, as his own intereſt, to terminate that Parliament, and therefore he did at this time put an end to their ſitting, <hi>February</hi> the fourth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1658. This Year began with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a moſt horrible Plot, as <hi>Oliver</hi> called it, and indeed he had an excellent Art for the diſcovery of Plots, having his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary trepans and inſtruments of falſhood, who counterfeiting themſelves forward Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, thereby inſinuated themſelves into the Counſel of the Kings friends, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them. And the King himſelf was troubled with one of theſe falſe Creatures about his own perſon; for Captain <hi>Manning,</hi> one of his Secretaries Clerks, was taken in the very act of receiving Letters from <hi>Thurloe Olivers</hi> Secretary, for the which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Shot to death. But the Loyal Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in the late diſcovered Plot, were divers of them apprehended, as Dr. <hi>Hewit,</hi> Colonel <hi>Edward Aſhton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boroughs</hi> Brother, and others, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of High Treaſon for endeavouring to levy War againſt his Highneſs and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to promote <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to the Government of theſe Nations, and for holding correſpondency with the ſaid <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> was acquitted; but Dr. <hi>Hewit,</hi>
                     <pb n="526" facs="tcp:109115:283"/>
and Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> were beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill June</hi> the eighth, though many endeavours were uſed by divers perſons of quality, and Miniſters, for the ſaving of their lives, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Doctors; Colonel <hi>Aſhton</hi> and others were hang'd and quartered in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Near about this time there came up the <hi>Thames,</hi> as far as <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a Whale of a very great length and bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> the 25th, the Town of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſigned it to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces, which had been the main inſtrument in gaining it; this reſignation was made according to former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles agreed upon between the King of <hi>France</hi> and Lord Protector of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were rejoicing abroad, <hi>Oliver</hi> had occaſion of ſorrow at home; for his moſt dearly beloved Daughter Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Claypole,</hi> on <hi>Auguſt</hi> the eighth departed this Life, whoſe body was interred in the Royal Chappel at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Tis ſaid of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, that ſhe was much troubled at the harſh uſage of the Royal party, and that upon her knees ſhe beg'd of her Father to ſave Dr. <hi>Hewits</hi> life; but his hard heart would not yield thereto, though he loved this Daughter ſo paſſionately, that he never injoyed himſelf after her death; but growing penſive and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, in ſhort time was ſeized with a <hi>Tertian</hi> ague, which ended his life at <hi>VVhite-hall,</hi> on <hi>September</hi> the third. He was born in the Town of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> and deſcended from a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful family of the <hi>Cromwels,</hi> alias <hi>VVilliams;</hi> his
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:109115:283"/>
Mother was the Daughter of Sir <hi>Richard Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and his wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>James Bourchier;</hi> He was of a very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirit, and of excellent conduct, and attended with very good ſucceſs in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. Nor was he a Souldier only, but alſo a very good Orator and deep Politician; and ſo great a Diſſembler, that he could ſhed <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codillian</hi> tears at pleaſure, when thoſe would at any time advantage him among the Religious; an high pretender he was to Religion, though, as his actions manifeſted, it was only thereby to obtain his ambitious ends; ſo impiouſly reſolute for the effecting his deſignments, that he valued not the violation of the moſt ſolemn promiſes, or ſacred Oaths; nor the ſhedding of any, though the blood of the Lords anointed. Yet was this Man courted or feared by moſt of the Princes in <hi>Europe;</hi> and the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> were entred into ſo ſtrict a League with him, as had he lived, might have troubled good part of the world.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Olivers</hi> ſtead, <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> his eldeſt Son, whom he had appointed his Succeſſor, was proclaimed Protector. Shortly after which, ſeveral Addreſſes, proteſting both love and obedience to <hi>Richards</hi> Highneſs, were preſented from the Armies of the three Nations, from the <hi>London</hi>-Miniſters, from divers Counties, Cities, and chief Towns of <hi>England.</hi> And the Foreign Ambaſſadors then in <hi>England</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to lament with Mr. <hi>Richard</hi> for the death of his Father; deſired the continuance of that League and Amity, which was granted,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:109115:284"/>
and maintained by his late Highneſs <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> the 23, were the Funerals of <hi>Oliver</hi> Solemnized (after his Herſe had lain in the greateſt State ſome weeks in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi>) at a vaſt charge, and in greater Pomp than had formerly been uſed for the greateſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings; his Corps had been privately interr'd many days before in the Chappel-Royal of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But the vaſt expences of thoſe Funerals were never diſcharged; but thoſe Tradeſmen who had hopes of gaining the moſt by it, ſat down the greateſt loſers at laſt. As ſoon at the Funeral-rites of this old Fox <hi>Oliver</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, his Son <hi>Richard</hi> proceeded to the carrying on of matters of publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of which was the ſending a Naval-ſupply to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the aiding him againſt the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The next of any moment was the calling of a Parliament to convene <hi>January</hi> the 27th, at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> where when they were met, they choſe for their Speaker, Mr <hi>Challoner Chute;</hi> and the Members ſeverally took the Oath, not to alter the form of Government. Which done, they went to purge out thoſe Members who had born Arms for the King; then after many debates it was at length reſolved, that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would tranſact with the perſons of the other Houſe, as a Houſe of Parliament, during the preſent Parliament: but with this proviſo, That it was not intended thereby to exclude ſuch Peers as have been faithful to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:109115:284"/>
from their priviledg of being duly ſummoned to be Members of that Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Then they took into their conſideration, the Caſes of divers perſons who had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the time of <hi>Oliver;</hi> Major General <hi>Overton,</hi> and others of the Common-wealth party they releaſed. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was alſo freed out of <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle, upon his Father-in-Law the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s giving 20000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſecurity, that he ſhould not ſeek by any means to promote the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> Next, after long and tedious debates, they yielded that the Members, who had been returned to ſerve for <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould continue to ſet amongſt them as Members for that preſent Parliament. They likewiſe proceeded to draw up a bill, which ſhould be entituled, An Act of Recognition of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his right and title to be Protector, and chief Magiſtrate of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. But this was never perfected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1659, The Army now grew jealous of his Highneſs, complaining of his company that he kept; how that divers of them were no better than Cavaliers; cenſuring his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alſo; giving out, that Godlineſs was diſcouraged by him; that he rather favoured thoſe of looſe principles, than the zealous profeſſors of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> the 6th, General <hi>Charles Fleetwood</hi> preſented the Protector a Repreſentation from the Officers of the Army, wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, That they who had born the brunt of the War, were now deſpiſed, and like to be laid aſide; That the Cavaliers held dangerous
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:109115:285"/>
meetings in and about <hi>London,</hi> That liſts of the names of ſuch who were the Tryers of the old King, were Printed in red Letters, and ſcattered about, as if they were men appointed for deſtruction: That the famous actions of the long Parliament, and his late Highneſs, in and ſince 1648, were traduced and vilified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſired that his Highneſs would be pleaſed to repreſent theſe things to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and procure their remedies. The Army alſo began to grow jealous alſo of the Parliament, as if they were too favourable to the Royal party, and joyned with the Protector to bring the Officers of the Army into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Thereupon the General-Council of Officers, held many meetings and conſultations, which the Parliament hearing of, voted that there ſhould be no meeting nor General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Officers, without conſent and by order of his Highneſs the Lord Protector: And that no perſon ſhould have any command in the Army, who ſhould refuſe to ſubſcribe that he will not diſturb the free meetings in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or their freedom in their debates and counſels. Theſe votes the Protector ſent to the Officers of the Army, which they valued not at all, but on the contrary reſolved, that the Parliament ſhould be diſſolved. And in order thereunto <hi>Deſbrough</hi> with other chief Officers, went to the Protector and forced him to ſign a Commiſſion for the Parliaments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and accordingly the Parliament was diſſolved. Which being effected, their next work was to put a period to the Protectors power, by reſtoring that remnant of the Long
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:109115:285"/>
Parliament, which his Father had turned out; to which end the Officers of the Army invited thoſe Members of Parliament, who continued ſitting till <hi>April</hi> the 20th, 1653. and promiſed them that they would be ready in their places to yield them their utmoſt aſſiſtance, that they might ſet and act in ſafety. Theſe Members ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted their invitation, and accordingly took their places in Parliament, <hi>May</hi> the ſeventh; and upon notice that theſe were again houſed, divers of thoſe that were ſecluded in 1648, attempted to have taken their places, but were repulſed.</p>
                  <p>Then theſe Members cauſed the Protectors Great Seal to be broken, and voted their own old Seal up again. Then ſent to the Protector for an acknowledgment from him of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their government; and accordingly on <hi>May</hi> the twenty-fifth he made his reſignation and ſubmiſſion; declaring in writing, That though in reſpect to the particular engagements that lay upon him, he could not be active in making a change in the Government of theſe Nations; yet through the goodneſs of God, he would freely acquieſce in its being made; and that he held himſelf ingaged, as (with other men) he expected Protection from the preſent Government; ſo to demean himſelf with all peaceableneſs under it, and to procure to the utmoſt of his power, that all in whom he had intereſt ſhould do the ſame. In ſhort time after this, <hi>Henry Cromwel</hi> came over, and yielded up the Lieutenancy of <hi>Ireland</hi> unto the Members ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> who appointed five Commiſſioners for the Government of that
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:109115:286"/>
Kingdom. General <hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf to their directions; and Colonel <hi>Lockhart,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> likewiſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Authority.</p>
                  <p>Then this <hi>Junto</hi> commanded all ſuch as had been in Arms for the King, to depart twenty Miles from <hi>London;</hi> paſſed an Act for ſetling of the Militia in the reſpective Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> Ordered a whole years Aſſeſsment at 35000 <abbr>l.</abbr> a month on <hi>England,</hi> 6000 <abbr>l.</abbr> the month on <hi>Scotland,</hi> and 9000 <abbr>l.</abbr> on <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be paid into the Treaſury before the eleventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next following. Ordered the immediate ſale of <hi>White-Hall, Hampton-Court,</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> towards payment of the Armies Arrears. To their <hi>quondam</hi> Protector they were ſo friendly, as to protect him from all arreſts; and withal to promiſe the payment of all his debts (for his Fathers Funeral and other occaſions), which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 29640 <abbr>l.</abbr> but this they never performed.</p>
                  <p>The while theſe things were in agitation, the Kings friends were very buſie in promoting his intereſt, by engaging as many as they could for his ſervice in all places of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo ſucceſsful was the Kings Commiſſioners, that great part of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> were intereſted by them in the Kings quarrel; and a day was fixed in <hi>July</hi> for their appearing in Arms; the firſt riſing was to be chiefly of ſuch as had never engaged on the Kings ſide in the late Wars, thereby to draw the Army unto a more faint oppoſition. Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton,</hi> and ſome other of the old Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:109115:286"/>
raiſed a party in <hi>Cheſhire, Flintſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to the number of about three or four thouſand men; who declared for a Free Parliament, and the due rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Nation, againſt that <hi>Phanatick</hi> and unlawful power which now uſurped do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them. But Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> marching ſpeedily againſt them, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring them, his old Souldiers without much bloodſhed totally routed them near unto <hi>Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich; Auguſt</hi> the 17th. Colonel <hi>Charles White</hi> raiſed a ſmall party in <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Derby-Shires:</hi> other inconſiderable parties were raiſed in other parts, but diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again; for the Rulers at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> having met with ſome hint of this deſigned riſing, had ſo ordered their ſtanding-Army and Militia-forces in moſt places of the Land, that no conſiderable parties of the Kings friends, could have opportunity to get into a Body.</p>
                  <p>After the defeat of Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> prepared an Act for ſequeſtring of the Eſtates of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as were engaged in this riſing; and in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their favour and gratitude, they order'd <hi>Lambert</hi> a thouſand pound for his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which he preſently diſtributed amongſt his Soldiers, thereby to engage them the more firmly to his deſigns: for though himſelf and other Grandees of the Army carried fair with the <hi>Junto,</hi> yet were they not well pleaſed with them, becauſe ſince their laſt ſitting they had ſomewhat leſſened the Armies power, in giving order to their Speaker <hi>William Lenthall</hi> to iſſue
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:109115:287"/>
out Commiſſions for Commanders, which had been done afore by the General; and had withal reſerved the chief command of the Army to themſelves, without any Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Therefore now whilſt they were fluſtred with their late Victory, they drew up their Propoſitions to be preſented to the Parliament, which they entituled, <hi>The humble Petition and Propoſal of the Army under the Right Honourable the Lord</hi> Lambert, <hi>in the late Northern expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therein deſiring that the Army might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by</hi> Fleetwood <hi>as chief General, by</hi> Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert <hi>as the next ſuperior General,</hi> &amp;c. This was ſent up to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army, to be preſented to the Parliament. But Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg</hi> being made acquainted with it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was delivered, immediately informed his fellow-Members thereof, alledging that it was a matter of moſt dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The <hi>Junto</hi> hereupon paſſed a Vote, That the having of more general Officers, was a thing needleſs, chargeable and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But the Army-Officers of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtill-proſecuting their intentions of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole ordering of the Army into their own hands, the <hi>Junto</hi> thereupon paſſed this Act, That it ſhould be Treaſon in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever, to raiſe, levy, or collect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys without conſent of Parliament; deſigning hereby to bring the Army into ſubjection, becauſe otherwiſe they could have no main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; they likewiſe ordered that <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Desbrough, Kelſey, Berry, Aſhfield, Cobbet, Packer, Barrow</hi> and <hi>Creed,</hi> ſhould be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated, and that others ſhould enjoy their
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:109115:287"/>
commands. They alſo ordered the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army to be in Seven Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in whom the power ſhould jointly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; theſe were <hi>Fleetwood, Monk, Ludlow, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Morley, Overton,</hi> and <hi>Haſlerigg.</hi> But <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Complices were reſolved to try a tug with the <hi>Junto</hi> who ſhould be Maſters; and to that end they engaged divers Companies and Regiments about <hi>London</hi> to ſide with them; and the <hi>Junto</hi> drew two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to take part with them; but when theſe two parties had ſtood at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in a hoſtile ſort, almoſt a whole day, facing each other, and ſometimes ready to fall to it in good earneſt; towards the evening the two parties fairly agreed to draw off to their reſpective quarters. And the next day, and forward, <hi>Lambert</hi> took care to guard the Parliament-doors that none of the Members might enter into the Houſe. And now the <hi>Junto</hi> being once more laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, <hi>Lambert</hi>'s party made choice of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Fleetwood</hi> to be Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army; <hi>Lambert</hi> (who 'tis thought aſpired to Soveraignty) to be Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and <hi>Desbrough</hi> to be Commiſſary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. They framed likewiſe a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on <hi>October</hi> the 26th. nominating Twenty-three perſons to have the management of publick affairs, whom they would have to be called a <hi>Committee of Safety.</hi> Their names were, <hi>Bulſtrode Whitlock, Edmund Ludlow,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> Sir <hi>James Harrington,</hi> Sir <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald Johnſon,</hi> General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> General <hi>John Lambert,</hi> Colonel <hi>Desbrough,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sydan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                     <pb n="536" facs="tcp:109115:288"/>
Major <hi>Saloway,</hi> Colonel <hi>Berry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> Colonel <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hewſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Lilburn, John Ireton</hi> Lord Maior, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman <hi>Robert Tichburn, Walter Strickland, Cornelius Holland, William Steel, Clerk, Bennet, Brandrith.</hi> Thus was miſerable <hi>England</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Arbitrary power of an Army, to have what Lords and Laws they pleaſed. But the time of its liberty approached, the principal inſtrument whereof was General <hi>George Monk,</hi> who pretending to a re-ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Junto,</hi> and not to be able to ſee the Nation ſo inſlaved by <hi>Lambert</hi> and his factious party, drew his Army out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having firſt changed ſome of his Officers. The Committee of Safety exceedingly courted this General to comply with them, and when that would not do, <hi>Lambert</hi> drew his Army into the North, with deſign to impede Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk</hi>'s march to <hi>London,</hi> but all their projects availed nothing with the General. And to help forward his Majeſties intereſt, and the Nations deliverance, the City of <hi>London</hi> grew very diſcontented and ſurly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Army; the Fleet, that declared for the <hi>Junto;</hi> likewiſe many of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s party withdrew themſelves from him, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in general was full of diſcontents and murmurings; inſomuch that the Committee of Safety perceived themſelves to be in a very unſafe and kind of deſolate condition; and therefore with great ſubmiſſion they ſent for the Speaker, deſiring him with the reſt of his follow-Members to return to the exerciſe of their truſt; which accordingly they did
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:109115:288"/>
on <hi>December</hi> the twenty-ſixth, and Colonel <hi>Lambert</hi> finding that all now went bad on his ſide, privately ſlipt away from his Soldiers (then about <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine</hi>) and they returned to their obedience to the <hi>Junto;</hi> who upon their reſettlement, Diſcommiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lambert,</hi> with divers Colonels and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army; publiſhed a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a Commonwealth, without a ſingle Perſon or Houſe of Lords, for preſervation of the Laws, upholding of the Miniſtry, the Univerſity and Tythes (all which had lately been in great danger) for maintaining liberty of Conſcience. General <hi>Monk</hi> in the mean time advanced with his new-modelled Army towards <hi>London,</hi> all the way being careſſed by the Gentry of the ſeveral Counties as he paſſed along, with all teſtimonies of affection, and petition for the reſtoring of the Secluded Members, and procuring of a Free Parliament, Commiſſioners were ſent to him from the City of <hi>London,</hi> with the like requeſt for a Free Parliament; but the General wiſely conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his inclinations and intentions, pretending ſtrong reſolutions to be faithful to thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and yet carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo much evenneſs, that the City and Country had hopes he would ſtand their friend, as the <hi>Junto</hi> could ſee but little cauſe to miſdoubt his real good meaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, howbeit to make him the ſurer on their ſide, they ordered him and his heirs a 1000 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                     <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> the third, General <hi>Monk</hi> came to <hi>London</hi> with his Army he had drawn out of
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:109115:289"/>
                     <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Army which had been quartered there, having marched out the night before by the <hi>Junto</hi>'s command, though not without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and ſome diſorder and mutiny: The next day his Excellency was conducted to the Parliament-Houſe, where he received thanks from the Members for his good ſervice; after which he acquainted them with the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Addreſſes he had received from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the admiſſion of the ſecluded Members, and a Free Parliament; minding them alſo of the danger themſelves and Nation would be in, if the Fanatick party ſhould be continued in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Military power. But the General's Speech was not well liked of by Mr. <hi>Tho. Scot,</hi> and ſome other of the Members. And the City of <hi>London,</hi> with whom they thought his Excellency too gracious, gave them greater cauſe of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; for the Common Council was now reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pay no more Taxes, till ſuch time that the Houſe was filled up with equal Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Hereupon the <hi>Junto</hi> reſolved to puniſh the City; and to make the General inſtrument in it, ordering him to ſeize upon eleven of the moſt active of the Common-Council, and commit them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and alſo to pull down, and break the Poſts, Chains, Gates, and Portculli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the City; which he put in execution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly on <hi>February</hi> the ninth, though not with any pleaſure to himſelf, but of neceſſity, that ſo the Houſe might not take any occaſion from his diſputing their commands to vacate his Commiſſion, and put him out of capacity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the bleſſed end he deſigned. Howbeit this action of the Generals did exceedingly amuſe
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:109115:289"/>
the loyal-hearted Citizens, and other good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and made them almoſt quite to give over the good hopes they had formerly had of him: But his Excellency, to put them out of all doubt concerning his intentions, bravely reſolved to put an end to the <hi>Junto</hi>'s power. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, the very next morning he ſent a Letter to the Houſe, therein complaining, that they gave too much countenance to <hi>Lambert, Vane,</hi> and ſeveral others that engaged with the late Committee of Safety; that they had too much favoured a Petition lately delivered by one <hi>Praiſe, God Barebone,</hi> and other Fanaticks; and then concludes with a prefixed day, before which they ſhould iſſue out Writs for a New Parliament, that ſo they might terminate their ſitting, and come to a diſſolution. The <hi>Junto</hi> receiving the Generals Letter, diſſemble their reſentment of it, and order him the Thanks of the Houſe for his faithful ſervice in ſecuring the City; yet the very ſame day, that they might limit his power, they paſt an Act for the Government of the Army by five Commiſſioners, he to be one of them, the other their own Creatures. The General hearing hereof, with all convenient ſpeed drew his Army together, and marched to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he gave the Secluded Members re-admiſſion into the Parlia-Houſe, <hi>February</hi> the 21, to the great grief of the Rump-Parliament, (for ſo the <hi>Junto</hi> was now called in ſcorn and contempt) and to the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding joy both of City and Country. And now the Parliament vote General <hi>Monk</hi> to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General of all the Forces in the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; conſtitute a new Council of State; ſet at
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:109115:290"/>
liberty Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and ſuch of his party as were Priſoners, alſo all ſuch as had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for petitioning for a Free Parliament; cauſed the Rump Militia, conſiſting moſt of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, to be disbanded; made ſuch Acts as might the beſt conduce to the ſettlement of the Nation; as, for the taking away all places of truſt and power out of the hands of the Sectarian party; alſo voted a Full and Free Parliament to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and to ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter, April</hi> the 25th. This Parliament was called Free, yet (as in all the Protectors Parliaments) no Loyaliſt that had been in actual Arms for the King, was capable of being elected for a Parliament-man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 17, the Long Parliament diſſolved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, leaving a Council of State to govern till the next Parliament ſhould aſſemble. But in the interim, that the Parliament was buſied for the recovering the peace and freedom of the Nation, ſome malecontents were very active for ſowing the ſeeds of diviſion in the Army, eſpecially in that part which had been for the Committee of Safety; yet by the care and prudence of General <hi>Monk</hi> (who diſplaced moſt of the Fanatick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers) their deſigns were fruſtrated. <hi>Lambert,</hi> after the diſſolution of the Parliament, attempted to involve the Nation again in a Civil War; but Col. <hi>Richard Ingoldsby</hi> diſperſed his ſmall force; and took him priſoner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.D.</hi> 1660, <hi>Apr.</hi> 20, the Free Parliament aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> on <hi>May</hi> 1. voted, That according to the ancient and fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, <hi>Charles</hi> the II. is the lawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtful King of theſe Nations. Tranſcendent was the joy all over <hi>England,</hi> which iſſued from
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:109115:290"/>
this good news. His Majeſty from his Court then at <hi>Breda,</hi> had ſent his Letters to both Houſes of Parliament, to General <hi>Monk,</hi> and to the City; to Admiral <hi>Montague,</hi> and the Officers of the Fleet, with alſo a Declaration to all his loving Subjects, the ſubſtance whereof was, That he did grant a free and general pardon to all his Subjects that ſhould within forty days lay hold upon his grace and favour, excepting ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſhould be excepted by Parliament. That he would ſhew all poſſible Indulgement to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences. And ſuch as differ in matter of Religion, ſo they did not diſturb the peace of the Kingdom, that he would preſerve them free from injury in their lives and eſtates; and that all things relating to ſales and purchaſes, (for there had been more lands bought and ſold in the late uſurping times, than what the right owners (loyal Subjects) had conſented to, ſhould be determined in Parliament: That he would take care for the full ſatisfaction of the arrears of the Soldiery under the command of General <hi>Monk,</hi> and that they ſhould be received into his ſervice, upon as good pay and conditions as at that preſent they enjoyed. The Parliament conſidering that his Majeſty had for many years been deprived of his Revenues, and therefore could not but be in want of money, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered that the ſum of 5000 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> ſhould be ſent him for a preſent; 10000 <abbr>

                     </abbr> to the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> The City of <hi>London</hi> likewiſe to teſtifie their gratitude to his Majeſty, ſent him 10000 <abbr>

                     </abbr> and to his two Brothers a 1000 <abbr>

who brought them his Majeſties Letters, to buy each of them a Ring; and the Parliament for the ſame reaſon gave 500<abbr>

                     <hi>May</hi> 8. by order of Parliament, <hi>Charles</hi> the II. was at <hi>London</hi> with very great ſolemnity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>The moſt Potent, Mighty and undoubted King of England, Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> at which time the Acclamations of the people were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful great, and their joys ſuch, that they could not find ways to expreſs them. <hi>May</hi> 22. his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency G. <hi>Monk</hi> ſet forth of <hi>London</hi> in order to meet his Majeſty; and <hi>May</hi> 23. his Majeſty with his Brothers ſet ſail for <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Hague,</hi> and on Friday landed at <hi>Dover,</hi> where the loyal General received the King. About 2 miles from <hi>Dover</hi> his Majeſty forſook his Coach, and took Horſe, his Brothers riding on his right hand, and the General on his left; after whom the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and many other Noblemen &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen followed in gallant Equipage. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſervice that G.

And being come to <hi>White-hall,</hi> he there in his Preſence-Chamber offered the Sacrifice of Peace and Thanksgiving, unto Almighty God for his wonderful reffauration. Then applied
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:109115:291"/>
himſelf to the ordering of his Court, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the chief Officers of State; His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> he inveſted with the Office of Lord High Admiral.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perſons were numerous that had in an extraordinary ſort been ſerviceable in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Kings intereſt, and his Majeſty had no other way to expreſs at preſent his gracious acceptance thereof to many of them, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honoured their name and family by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on them according to their merit the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Duke, Earl, Viſcount, Baron, Knight. <hi>Jun.</hi> 6. the Parliament ſet forth a Proclamation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was declared, That all ſuch of the late Kings Judges as would not render themſelves within ſo many days to their mercy, ſhould be excepted out of the general pardon then prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; whereupon 20 of the <hi>Regicides</hi> came out of their coverts, and preſenting themſelves to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to cuſtody. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the long expected Act of Indempnity was paſſed, by which all that had been any ways engaged againſt the King were pardoned, ſave the <hi>Regicides</hi> and a very few others; and amongſt thoſe there were three

who were freed in reſpect of life, liberty, and eſtate, becauſe they had given evident ſigns of their hearty ſorrow for that crying ſin. It was alſo Enacted that the 30. of <hi>January</hi> ſhould to all Poſterities be obſerved a day of Humiliation for that great wickedneſs of murdering Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent the King. Alſo, that <hi>May</hi> 29. ſhould in all ſucceeding ages be obſerved a day of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for the Kings peaceable Reſtauration to the actual poſſeſsion and exerciſe of his Legal authority over his Subjects. An Act for Pole-money was likewiſe paſſed, and an Act for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling Soldiers of the Army to exerciſe Trades in any Corporation, that thereby they might be in a capacity of living honeſtly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly after their disbanding.</p>

                     <hi>September</hi> the thirteenth, That hopeful Prince <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> departed this life; and on the ſame day the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adjourned to the ſixth of <hi>November</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>October,</hi> Major General <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Carew,</hi> and other of the Regicides, were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at the old <hi>Bayly</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> where they were all found guilty and condemned to die the death due to Traytors.

All ſave <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> dyed very reſolutely. The perſons whoſe names follow, had the favour to be reprieved after Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe they delivered themſelves to

                  <p>After his Majeſty had given his Royal aſſent to the Acts preſented him, he made a Speech to both Houſes, wherein he uſed theſe memorable expreſſions, That this Parliament ſhould be called to all poſterity, The Healing and the Bleſſed Parliament.</p>

                     <hi>January</hi> the thirtieth, were the dead bodies of thoſe infamous Traytors, <hi>Cromwell, Ireton, Bradſhaw,</hi> (all buried at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi>) taken out of their Coffins, and drawn upon <hi>Hurdles</hi> to <hi>Tyburn;</hi> they were hang'd by the neck for ſome hours, then had their heads chopt off, which were perched upon <hi>VVeſtminſter-hall;</hi> and their bodies thrown into a hole under the Gallows.</p>
                  <p>This Year of Jubilee were the lands of the Kings Loyal Subjects reſtored to them that had been unjuſtly taken from them, by the late Uſurper; the Biſhops, Deans, and Chapters

                  <p>UPon the Second of <hi>September,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two of the Clock in the Morning, began that dreadful Fire in <hi>London,</hi> which laſted till Thurſday following, the Sixth of the ſame Moneth: It began in the Houſe of one <hi>Fariner</hi> a Baker in <hi>Pudding-lane</hi> near the <hi>Bridge,</hi> and ſpread it ſelf in length (beſides breadth) from the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to St. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> Church near <hi>Temple-bar</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet;</hi> by which, according to the Computation of Surveyors, were conſumed 373 Acres of Building, within the Walls of <hi>London,</hi> and 63 Acres 3 Roods without the Walls; 87 Pariſh Churches, 6 Conſecrated Chappels, the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> of the City; with many ſtately Halls belonging to ſeveral Companies; and according to the beſt accompt, Thirteen thouſand two hundred Houſes. The total of the loſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by theſe devouring Flames, was valued to be Nine millions and nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds Sterling. That the hand of God (for the puniſhment of the ſins of this City and Nation) was viſible
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109115:296"/>
in this Fire, no man will deny; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careleſneſs or deſign, were the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate occaſions of it, is variouſly believed and diſcourſed of. As it happened in the time of a War with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſo many at that time did conclude it to be a treacherous Act of one, or both of theſe People; eſpecially ſeeing one <hi>Hubert</hi> a crazy-brain'd melanchollick French Man, confeſſed he did the Fact, by putting a Fire-ball into the Houſe of the Baker where it began; and was therefore hang'd at <hi>Tyburn.</hi> But of late one Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> of whom more particular mention ſhall be made hereafter, lays the guilt of this mercileſs Action on a knot of <hi>Jeſuits, Friers,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh men,</hi> in all to the number of 80 or thereabouts; who having laid the project long before, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently put it in execution till this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky time.</p>
                  <p>This fatal Accident, the fore-runner of many more of the ſame kind, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in His Majeſties Dominions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, gave the King a ſad opportunity of exerciſing His Compaſſion and Care towards many diſtreſſed and diſtracted Families, who then lodged in the open Fields, under the Canopy of Heaven: His Majeſty therefore not only iſſued out Proclamations to Juſtices of the Peace for cauſing Proviſions to be ſent into the Markets, and ordered His Sea-ſtores to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109115:296"/>

                  <p>The Parliament met on the 18th of <hi>September,</hi> and having given the King Supplies for carrying on of the War, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Act for eſtabliſhing a Judicature, to take Cogniſance of, and determine all, differences that might ariſe among Parties, concerning burnt or demolliſhed Houſes.

                  <p>The Court ſeldom eſcapes free, when Combuſtions rage in the City, nor did it at this time, for by careleſneſs in uſing of a Candle, a Fire taking in the Horſe-guard at <hi>White-hall,</hi> a great part of that Building was burnt down; but by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of His Majeſty and His Guards, its progreſs was quickly ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty at this time meeting with bad uſage from many hands, in order to a redreſs, publiſhed ſeveral Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; one for prohibiting the Importation of <hi>Canary</hi> Wines, and all Commerce with thoſe Parts; another to the ſame effect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109115:297"/>
with <hi>France,</hi> and all the French Kings Dominions; a third upon the humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Lords and Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for baniſhing the Kingdom all Prieſts and Jeſuits, and a fourth for open War with <hi>Denmark.</hi>

                  <p>The City now aſhamed to lie longer ſmuthered under aſhes, was by Sir <hi>Jonas Moore,</hi> upon his Conformity to the Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Model of Building, appointed by the Committee, firſt rowſed in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> from which beginning it grew ſo haſtily towards a perfection, that in a few years it out did all its ancient Splendour and Glory, and appeared again far more beautiful than by its fall it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and abject; no leſs a wonder than the ſuddenneſs of its overthrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time ſhared likewiſe in Combuſtions, though occaſioned by a Fire of another nature; for a ſeditious Zeal having inſpired ſome male-contents with revenge againſt Sir <hi>James Turner</hi> for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting (too vigorouſly as they pretended) the Laws againſt them, they committed an inſolent Riot upon his Perſon, and hardly forbore the cutting of him in pieces. This Tumult was at firſt raiſed by a ſmall inconſiderable Rabble, but in a ſhort time they encreaſed to a body of 1600 men, who marching ſtreight towards <hi>Edenbourgh,</hi> were encountred and defeated by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109115:297"/>
Forces, commanded by Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant General <hi>Dalyell</hi> and Major General <hi>Drammond.</hi> Many of the Rebels were ſlain, more taken, whereof the Ring-leaders were executed, and the reſt either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or otherways puniſhed by Law.</p>

                  <p>The Iſland of <hi>Tobago</hi> was this year taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change whereof, the <hi>Dutch</hi> took St. <hi>Helena</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of very bad conſequence to the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; had it not been re-taken by Captain <hi>Monday,</hi> with three <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Merchant Men beſides, which fully paid the charges of its repriſal. For this good ſervice Captain <hi>Monday</hi> was Knighted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> this year were firſt at Sea, and attempted a vain project, of ſtopping up thoſe narrow Channels that give entry to the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, put out to encounter them; but they retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Shoar, the Prince ſtood to the Weſt-ward, that he might joyn the <hi>French</hi> and part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleets. This being ſhortly after done, the whole Fleet made toward the coaſt of <hi>Holland;</hi> and the Prince finding them before <hi>Schon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt,</hi> ſecured by their Banks and the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the Water, on the 28th of <hi>May</hi> detached a Squadron of Thirty five ſmall Frigots to provoke them to an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The <hi>Dutch,</hi> contrary to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109115:306"/>
came forth in good order and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt but a few common Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and not one Ship.

The <hi>Dutch</hi> being about the <hi>Goree,</hi> got the Wind of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and bore briskly down upon them, the Fight was obſtinate and bloody on both ſides, eſpecially between Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109115:306"/>
Sprague</hi> and <hi>van Tromp;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> making as if they ſtood off for the Wind, did it in reallity, that they might have the conveniency of being Spectators. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> who had been engaged together all day, finding themſelves at diſtance from their reſpective Squadrons, ſtood back again to their aſſiſtance; and <hi>de Ruyter</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have cut off the blew Squadron from the reſt of the Fleet, was ſo ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged by the Prince, that he was fain to give way; ſo that had the <hi>French</hi> made uſe of their Wind they had, the <hi>Dutch</hi> had certainly ſuſtained far greater loſs then they did, and not ſo eaſily drawn off by favour of the Night. In this Engagement Sir <hi>Edward Sprague,</hi> as he was ſhifting from one Ship to another, had his long Boat by a Random Shot ſhivered to pieces under him, and ſo to the grief and regret of all that knew him, was drowned; his Ship ſtrangely diſabled, was by his valiant Second, the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> brought off. Captain <hi>Neve</hi> was ſlain, <hi>Reeves</hi> and <hi>Heywood</hi> died of their Wounds, and <hi>Martel</hi> only of the <hi>French</hi> was killed. The loſs of common Seamen was not very great on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide. The <hi>Dutch</hi> loſt two Flag Officers, ſeveral Captains, and about a 1000 common Seamen.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of <hi>June,</hi> the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> reſigned his Treaſurers Staff, and

                  <p>This month was the celebrated Town of <hi>Stetin</hi> in <hi>Pomerania</hi> ſurrendred to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> by the <hi>Swedes;</hi> a Town which having ſo couragiouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo long and bloody a Siege, to the admiration of all, and ſhame of ſome of its Neighbours, deſerves an honourable mention in the Hiſtories and Annals of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament, purſuant to their laſt Adjournment, having met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:109115:312"/>
received an Intimation from the King, That His Majeſty had matters of very great Importance to communicate to both Houſes, in order to the ſatisfaction of their late Addreſſes for the preſervation of <hi>Flanders;</hi> but matters not being then ripe enough, it was His Majeſties Pleaſure they ſhould be Adjourned till the twenty eighth of the ſame month; and accordingly they were Adjourned.</p>
                  <p>At the prefixed time they met again, and the King in a gracious Speech ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted both Houſes to this purpoſe, <hi>That according to His Promiſe to them, that He would do ſomewhat for their ſatisfaction before they met again, he had made Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with</hi> Holland <hi>for the preſervation of</hi> Flanders, <hi>which if ſeconded by plentiful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from them, and due Care from the Spai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards for their own Preſervation, might be able by Arms to reſtore ſuch an honourable Peace to Chriſtendom, as might not be in the power of one Prince alone to diſturb; which he had endeavoured to do by a fair Treaty: That He had married His Niece to the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>and ſo engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to maintain his Intereſt: and having laid before them the expences He had been at, and what an actual War would needs require, with very preſſing conſiderations, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty demanded of them anſwerable Supplies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March,</hi> the 20th 1677/8, Amongſt other Bills in Parliament, there paſſed an Act for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109115:312"/>
raiſing Money by Poll and otherways, to enable His Majeſty to enter into an Actual War againſt the French King; with a Prohibition of all French Commodities.</p>
                  <p>Many of the Forces raiſed by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſince <hi>September</hi> laſt,<note place="margin">

                  <p>About this time at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> happened a great Diſorder, occaſioned by a rude Action of a Burgher, who in time of a Proceſſion, ſtruck a Dutch Captain with a lighted Torch over the Face, becauſe he did not uncover himſelf ſo ſoon as the Townſman would have had him; this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned preſently the drawing of many Swords; and the Engliſh being falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of the Tumult, ſome Soldiers were killed in the Streets; but by the care of the Magiſtrates and Officers, the Stir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quieted, and the truth of the matter diſcovered, the Magiſtrates of the Town impriſoned and puniſhed ſome of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109115:313"/>
of the Tumult; and to ſatisfie their trouble at the accident, treated the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Officers and Soldiers, and publiſhed a Placaet in their Juſtification, charging all Perſons to uſe the ſaid Soldiers with all kindneſs and civility.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday, <hi>April</hi> the 13th, A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Swanſey</hi> was brought to Bed of a dead Female Child, which had two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heads and Necks upon one Body, with all the parts of each Head exact, and the Members of the Body perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> the 13th, His Majeſty being come into the Houſe of Lords with the uſual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, and the Houſe of Commons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for, His Majeſty was pleaſed to give His Royal Aſſent to ſeveral private Acts, and then commanded the Lord Chancellour to prorogue the Parliament till the twenty third of this moneth; and accordingly the Parliament was prorogued.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament, purſuant to the laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, having met the 23d. of <hi>May,</hi> and continued ſitting till the Fifteenth of <hi>July</hi> following; His Majeſty that day in His Robes, came into the Houſe of Lords, and there gave His Royal Aſſent to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts; amongſt which, to one for raiſing Money for Disbanding of the Army, a great part of which was now in <hi>Flanders,</hi> another for granting an Additional Duty to His Majeſty upon Wines for three

years; a third for burying in Woollen; and a fourth for the relief and diſcharge of poor diſtreſſed Priſoners for Debt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Lord Chancellour, by His Majeſties Command, acquainted the two Houſes, That His Majeſty had thought fit in the preſent Conjuncture of Affairs, to prorogue them to the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and ſo to keep them in call by ſhort Prorogations; His Majeſty not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſoon He might have need of their farther Service and Aſſiſtance; but that His Majeſties intention was, they ſhould not meet till towards Winter, unleſs there were occaſion for their Aſſembling ſooner, of which he would give them timely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by Proclamation: And accordingly the Parliament was prorogued till the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In purſuance of this Prorogation, the Parliament met at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and were then by Commiſſion Prorogued till the 29th of the ſame Month; at which time his Majeſty being willing they ſhould meer, and continue Sitting for the diſpatch of weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, did iſſue out a Proclamation, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the Members to give their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the ſaid day. But the face of Affairs abroad being much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the concluſion of the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>French</hi> King, and the States of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> which was Signed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109115:314"/>
at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty thought fit likewiſe to change his reſolution: And therefore by Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on declared, that both Houſes ſhould be Prorogued from the 29th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> till the firſt of <hi>October</hi> following; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by another Proclamation to the one and twentieth of the ſame Month, at which time his Majeſty required a full Meeting of the Members, in order to their Sitting for the diſpatch of weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which indeed happened to be of greater concern than was imagined.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was now march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Army to the Relief of <hi>Mons,</hi> at this time Blockt up by the <hi>French</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi> before he had the News of the Peace: And his Highneſs, accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being advanced near the Enemies Camp at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> bravely attacqued it, and after a long and brisk diſpute forcing the <hi>French</hi> to diſlodge, poſſeſſed himſelf of their Ground. The Prince and Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> were in great danger in this Engagement, but both came off without any hurt, the Earl of <hi>Oſſory</hi> commanded his Majeſties Subjects that were in the States Service, who gained not the leaſt ſhare in the Honour of this Day's Action, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gallant Men periſhed in the Attempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109115:314"/>In <hi>September</hi> came to light, a Deſign which had been doubtleſs long contriving in the blackeſt Cell of Darkneſs: A Plot that amazed moſt Men, allarmed all, and gave work enough ſince to his Majeſty, Parliament, and Judges of the Land; but ſeeing it is not as yet ſo fully dicloſed, (at leaſt to the Publick) as may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently warrant an authentick Relation thereof to Poſterity, no man can expect much to be ſaid on't in this Abridgement; which intends only to point at the moſt remarkable Occurrences of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and is propoſed rather as an Index than Chronicle to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>The matter then was briefly thus. One Mr. <hi>Titus Oats</hi> having received his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Orders in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſome Years ago, went over the Seas into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and afterward into <hi>Spain,</hi> ingratiating himſelf among the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits by ſuch means and to ſuch purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as are ſet down in his Depoſitions lately made Publick; upon his Return, ſoon after, this Gentleman, adviſes with one Doctor <hi>Tongue,</hi> about the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of what he had learn'd abroad, and ſo theſe two went together to Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey,</hi> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, whom Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> informed of a Plot hatched by Jeſuits, Prieſts, and others of the ſame Roman-Catholick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109115:315"/>
Perſwaſion, againſt the Perſon and Life of his Majeſty, the beſt of Kings, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and Government of the Kingdom. And for confirmation of what he ſaid, diſcovered many perſons of ſeveral Qualities, who were ingaged in the Deſign; ſome as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for aſſaſſinating his Majeſty, and others for carrying on the remaining part of the work, by Arms, Forreign Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances, and ſuch other Expedients, as they Judged neceſſary for the Succeſs of their Enterpriſe His Majeſty and the Council being acquainted with this, Orders were given out for the apprehending and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to cuſtody of many perſons; of whom ſome have ſince ſuffered, ſome died in Priſon, and many more are ſtill in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. To enumerate all, would be more tedious than neceſſary in this Manual; and to name but a few, would be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious either to thoſe mentioned, or to the Publick, in omitting of others who ſtand accuſed of the ſame combination: we ſhall therefore ſpeak only of thoſe who have been ſince brought to publick Tryal, and leave it to Time, and the Care of our Governours, to make Publick the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> who had taken, and given in to the Council, the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Evidence, was on <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>October,</hi> miſſing from his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109115:315"/>
Houſe, and no News could be heard of him till <hi>Thurſday</hi> following; at which time he was found dead in a Ditch by <hi>Primroſe-hill,</hi> with a Sword thruſt through his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but nothing, except his Pocket Book, taken from him. This Murder was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by all Men to be an Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or ſome ſpightful Malice, and not of unlawful deſire of Lucre; ſeeing his Money and Rings, which were no inconſiderable Prize, were left with him: And therefore His Majeſty being returned from <hi>New-Market,</hi> cauſed a Proclamation to be Publiſhed the 20th of <hi>October,</hi> for the Diſcovery of this Inhumane Murder; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing a Reward of Five Hundred Pounds to any that ſhould diſcover the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or any of them; and if the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer proved to be one of the Malefactors, not only his Pardon, but likewiſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Sum.</p>
                  <p>After the Parliament, according to the laſt Prorogation, had met the 21th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which was their laſt Seſſion; the King being informed that ſome who could give information of the Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey,</hi> did forbear to do it out of fear to their Perſons from the Murderers Friends; His Majeſty emitted another Proclamation, promiſing on the word of a King, not only the ſaid Reward of Five Hundred Pounds, but ſuch Care for the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109115:316"/>
Security of the Diſcoverer, as he ſhould in reaſon propoſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Proclamations at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired courage into <hi>William Bedlow,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Servant to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> to make a Diſcovery of this Murder, which he and one <hi>Praunce</hi> a Silver Smith in <hi>Princes ſtreet,</hi> that confeſſed himſelf to have been in the Fact, made out afterwards againſt three of thoſe that were Guilty, the reſt having Fled. And according to his Majeſties Promiſe, Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> had been before) was allowed Guards for his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Accommodation and Subſiſtence at his Majeſties Charge in <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King and Parliament being ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the ſtrangeneſs of this miſchievous Plot, betook themſelves to the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ways of diſcovering the ſame, and preventing the fatal Effects thereof; and therefore in the firſt place, upon the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, his Majeſty cauſed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be publiſhed for a general Faſt throughout the whole Kingdom, to be obſerved on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the Thirteenth of <hi>November,</hi> for imploring the mercy and and protection of Almighty God to his Majeſties Royal Perſon, and in him to all his Loyal Subjects; and to pray that God would bring to light more and more all ſceret machinations againſt his Majeſty and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109115:316"/>
the whole Kingdom. This day of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation was accordingly obſerved throughout all <hi>England,</hi> and a form of Prayer by his Majeſties Command com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and publiſhed for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, His Majeſty cauſed ſeveral Proclamations, and Orders of Council to be publiſhed for the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Diſabling of Popiſh Recuſants: The Firſt of the 30th of <hi>October,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manding all Popiſh Recuſants, or ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, to depart from the Cities of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and all other places within ten Miles of the ſame, was ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Order of Council, on the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> wherein his Majeſty promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a reward of Twenty Pounds, to thoſe that ſhould Diſcover any Officer or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of his Majeſties Guards, who having formerly taken the Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy, and the Teſt, had ſince been perverted, or ſhould hereafter be perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Romiſh Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ninth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> his Majeſty came in his Robes into the Houſe of Lords; whither the Commons being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his Majeſty made a Gracious Speech, thanking, both Houſes for the Care they ſhewed for the ſafety and preſervation of his Perſon, promiſing the like on his part for them, and offering his ready Aſſent to the paſſing into Laws all ſuch Bills as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109115:317"/>
might ſecure their Religion, not only during his own Reign, but alſo in the Reign of His Succeſſors; provided they did not impeach the right of Succeſſion in the true Line, nor reſtrain the power and juſt rights of His Majeſty or His Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Succeſſors.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after His Majeſty iſſued out ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proclamations, as one for confining all Popiſh Recuſants within five miles of their reſpective dwellings; another for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending ſome perſons therein named, who were accuſed of the helliſh Plot; and a third, promiſing a preſent reward of twenty pounds to any that ſhould diſcover and cauſe to be apprehended, any Popiſh Prieſt or Jeſuit, except thoſe that were privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Law of the Land or that of Nations, as ſerving the Queen or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Miniſters.</p>
